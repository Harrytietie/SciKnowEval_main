Diagnosis and residency status were confirmed through the medical record. Incidence rates were directly standardized to the 2010 US population. Poisson regression was used to test for a change in incidence rate. Clinical charts were reviewed to confirm case status.\nRESULTS: There were 233 incident cases of T1D. Directly adjusting for age and sex with respect to the 2010 US white population, the overall annual incidence of T1D was 9.2 (95% CI, 8.0-10.4) per 100,000 people per year among all ages and 19.9 (95% CI, 16.6-23.2) per 100,000 people per year for those younger than 20 years.

Abnormal regulation of CRH and endogenous glucocorticoids has been implicated in the pathogenesis of asthma.\nOBJECTIVE: We postulated that CRH deficiency could increase asthma severity by disrupting hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis function and the induction of glucocorticoids through inflammatory and physiologic stress. However, CRH is expressed by several types of immune cells and might be induced at sites of inflammation, where it has local immunostimulatory actions. Thus CRH deficiency could decrease asthma severity.\nMETHODS: To test these possibilities, we subjected CRH-knockout mice to an ovalbumin-induced airway inflammation protocol that mimics many features of asthma.\nRESULTS: CRH-knockout mice had an increase in airway inflammation of approximately 80% to 300% and an increase in goblet cell hyperplasia of approximately 70% compared with wild-type mice. In contrast, IgE induction was unaffected by CRH deficiency. The increased inflammation in knockout mice was associated with increased tissue resistance, elastance, and hysteresivity. Levels of IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, RANTES, IFN-gamma, and eotaxin were all increased in knockout mice. Serum corticosterone levels were decreased in knockout mice and might account for some of the differences between knockout and wild-type mice.\nQuestion: Does corticotropin-releasing hormone deficiency increase allergen-induced airway inflammation in a mouse model of asthma?"}], "answer": "[True]. We conclude that CRH deficiency disrupts endogenous glucocorticoid production and enhances allergen-induced airway inflammation and lung mechanical dysfunction in mice.

Patients with low BMD had a blunted nocturnal rise in PTH concentration and reduced PTH target-organ sensitivity compared with patients with normal BMD; these factors may be important in the pathogenesis of AGHD-related osteoporosis.\nBACKGROUND: Adult growth hormone deficiency (AGHD) is associated with decreased BMD. Reduced parathyroid gland sensitivity to changes in calcium and reduced PTH target-organ sensitivity may underlie the pathogenesis of AGHD-related osteoporosis. A blunted nocturnal PTH rise has been reported in AGHD and may contribute to the reduction in BMD. We examined the difference in PTH concentration and markers of bone metabolism in patients with AGHD with normal and low BMD.\nMETHODS: Forty-three patients with AGHD consented to the study. Twenty-five patients were growth hormone (GH) na\u00efve (GH-N, 13 had BMD femoral neck or lumbar spine T-score < -1.0), and 18 patients had received GH for >2 yr (GH-R, 10 had BMD T-score < -1.0). Patients were hospitalized for 24 h, where blood samples were collected every 0.5 h and urine samples were collected every 3 h for PTH, calcium, phosphate, NcAMP, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)(2)D], type-I collagen beta C-telopeptide (betaCTX), and procollagen type-I amino-terminal propeptide (PINP). Serum calcium was adjusted for albumin (ACa).\nRESULTS: Low BMD GH-N and GH-R patients exhibited a reduced nocturnal rise in PTH concentration compared with patients with normal BMD (p < 0.001). GH-N low BMD patients had significantly higher 24-h mean PTH (p < 0.001) than GH-N normal BMD patients, with significantly lower 24-h mean NcAMP, ACa, and 1,25(OH)(2)D (p < 0.01), suggesting a reduction in renal PTH sensitivity. GH-R low BMD patients had significantly lower 24-h mean PTH, NcAMP, ACa, and 1,25(OH)(2)D (p < 0.01) than GH-R normal BMD patients, suggesting reduced renal PTH action. Lower PTH concentration in the presence of lower ACa may reflect reduced sensitivity of the parathyroid calcium-sensing receptor to changes in ACa concentration in the GH-R low BMD patients.\nQuestion: Is pTH circadian rhythm and PTH target-organ sensitivity altered in patients with adult growth hormone deficiency with low BMD?"}], "answer": "[True]. Low BMD in GH-N and GH-R AGHD patients may be a consequence of abnormalities in PTH circadian rhythmicity together with reduced parathyroid gland and target-organ sensitivity. Further studies are needed to determine the potential benefit of therapeutic manipulation of PTH rhythmicity and sensitivity on BMD."}

In some species, the capacity to repair tissues is limited to the healing of wounds. Other species, such as echinoderms, posses a striking repair capability that can include the replacement of entire organs. It has been reported that some mechanisms, namely extracellular matrix remodeling, appear to occur in most repair processes. However, it remains unclear to what extent the process of organ regeneration, particularly in animals where loss and regeneration of complex structures is a programmed natural event, is similar to wound healing. We have now used the sea cucumber Holothuria glaberrima to address this question.\nRESULTS: Animals were lesioned by making a 3-5 mm transverse incision between one of the longitudinal muscle pairs along the bodywall. Lesioned tissues included muscle, nerve, water canal and dermis. Animals were allowed to heal for up to four weeks (2, 6, 12, 20, and 28 days post-injury) before sacrificed. Tissues were sectioned in a cryostat and changes in cellular and tissue elements during repair were evaluated using classical dyes, immmuohistochemistry and phalloidin labeling. In addition, the temporal and spatial distribution of cell proliferation in the animals was assayed using BrdU incorporation. We found that cellular events associated with wound healing in H. glaberrima correspond to those previously shown to occur during intestinal regeneration. These include: (1) an increase in the number of spherule-containing cells, (2) remodeling of the extracellular matrix, (3) formation of spindle-like structures that signal dedifferentiation of muscle cells in the area flanking the lesion site and (4) intense cellular division occurring mainly in the coelomic epithelium after the first week of regeneration.\nQuestion: Do common cellular events occur during wound healing and organ regeneration in the sea cucumber Holothuria glaberrima?"}], "answer": "[True]. Our data indicate that H. glaberrima employs analogous cellular mechanisms during wound healing and organ regeneration. Thus, it is possible that regenerative limitations in some organisms are due either to the absence of particular mechanisms associated with repair or the inability of activating the repair process in some tissues or stages."}

In this study, we investigated the safety, therapeutic effect, and mechanism(s) of topical OFSC administration in an extensive alkali-induced corneal wound.\nMETHODS: Corneal injury was created by contact of a piece of 0.5 N NaOH-containing filter paper on the corneal surface of a male Balb/c mouse for 30 s. The area of the filter paper covered the central 70% or 100% of the corneal surface. OFSCs (2 \u00d7 10(5)) in 5 \u03bcl phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) were given by topical administration (T) twice a day or by two intralimbal (IL) injections in the right cornea, while 5 \u03bcl of PBS in the left cornea served as the control.\nRESULTS: Topical OFSCs promoted corneal re-epithelialization of both the limbal-sparing and limbal-involved corneal wounds. In the first three days, topical OFSCs significantly reduced alkali-induced corneal edema and stromal infiltration according to a histopathological examination. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence staining revealed that transplanted cells were easily detectable in the corneal epithelium, limbal epithelium and stroma, but only some of transplanted cells at the limbal epithelium had differentiated into cytokeratin 3-expressing cells. OFSCs did not alter neutrophil (Ly6G) levels in the cornea, but significantly reduced macrophage (CD68) infiltration and inducible nitrous oxide synthetase (iNOS) production during acute corneal injury as quantified by a Western blot analysis. Continuous topical administration of OFSCs for seven days improved corneal transparency, and this was accompanied by diffuse stromal engraftment of transplanted cells and differentiation into p63-expressing cells at the limbal area. The therapeutic effect of the topical administration of OFSCs was superior to that of the IL injection. OFSCs from the IL injection clustered in the limbal area and central corneal epithelium, which was associated with a persistent corneal haze.\nQuestion: Does topical administration of orbital fat-derived stem cells promote corneal tissue regeneration?"}], "answer": "[True]. Topical OFSC administration is a simple, non-surgical route for stem cell delivery to promote corneal tissue regeneration through ameliorating acute inflammation and corneal epithelial differentiation. The limbal area serves as a niche for OFSCs differentiating into corneal epithelial cells in the first week, while the stroma is a potential site for anti-inflammation of OFSCs. Inhibition of corneal inflammation is related to corneal transparency."}

In virus-producing cells, IFITMs coalesce with forming virions and are incorporated into viral particles. Expression of IFITMs during virion assembly leads to the production of virion particles of decreased infectivity that are mostly affected during entry in target cells.

To assess intra-patient heterogeneity of LINE-1 methylation in CRC and to understand its biological relevance in invasion and metastasis, we evaluated the LINE-1 methylation at multiple tumor sites. In addition, the influence of stromal cell content on the measurement of LINE-1 methylation in tumor tissue was analyzed.\nMETHODS: Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded primary tumor tissue was obtained from 48 CRC patients. Matched adjacent normal colon tissue, lymph node metastases and distant metastases were obtained from 12, 18 and 7 of these patients, respectively. Three different areas were microdissected from each primary tumor and included the tumor center and invasive front. Normal mucosal and stromal cells were also microdissected for comparison with the tumor cells. The microdissected samples were compared in LINE-1 methylation level measured by multicolor MethyLight assay. The assay results were also compared between microdissected and macrodissected tissue samples.\nRESULTS: LINE-1 methylation within primary tumors showed no significant intra-tumoral heterogeneity, with the tumor center and invasive front showing identical methylation levels. Moreover, no difference in LINE-1 methylation was observed between the primary tumor and lymph node and distant metastases from the same patient. Tumor cells showed significantly less LINE-1 methylation compared to adjacent stromal and normal mucosal epithelial cells. Consequently, LINE-1 methylation was significantly lower in microdissected samples compared to macrodissected samples. A trend for less LINE-1 methylation was also observed in more advanced stages of CRC.\nQuestion: Does lINE-1 methylation show little intra-patient heterogeneity in primary and synchronous metastatic colorectal cancer?"}], "answer": "[True]. LINE-1 methylation shows little intra-patient tumor heterogeneity, indicating the suitability of its use for molecular diagnosis in CRC. The methylation is relatively stable during CRC progression, leading us to propose a new concept for the association between LINE-1 methylation and disease stage."}

The time-reaction curves were analysed determining their gradient (T1) and their onset (T2) as well as the half effect time (HET).\nRESULTS: Phagocytes from patients with XLA showed a significantly accelerated basal phagocytosis (reduction of HET by 24% p < 0.001) compared to healthy controls. After incubation with B/T (10 microg/ml each) speed of phagocytosis was nearly doubled (phagocyte activity p < 0.0001, Candida uptake p < 0.003), T2 of respiratory burst was reduced by 65 % (p < 0.0001) and killing was accelerated by 27% (p < 0.046). However, the maximal activities of all kinetics were not altered. Incubation of phagocytes from healthy controls with B/T accelerated phagocytosis to a level comparable to that of untreated phagocytes from patients with XLA and also accelerated reactive oxygen species (ROS) production (reduction of HET by 28%, p < 0.012).

Chondrogenesis was assessed by up-regulation of collagen types II and X, and aggrecan mRNA, secretion of collagen type II protein and sulfated glycosaminoglycans (sGAG), and by alkaline phosphatase induction. Chondrogenic stimulation of SMPC by the equine BMP-2 adenovirus was assessed by sGAG secretion and histology.\nRESULTS: The mature equine BMP-2 peptide is identical to human and murine peptides. Recombinant human BMP-2 and TGF-\u03b21 stimulated equivalent amounts of collagen type II protein in SMPC pellets, but sGAG secretion was doubled by BMP-2. Neither factor stimulated hypertrophic marker expression. The equine BMP-2 adenoviral vector induced chondrogenesis comparably to rhBMP-2 protein, with no indication of hypertrophy.\nQuestion: Does bone morphogenetic protein 2 stimulate chondrogenesis of equine synovial membrane-derived progenitor cells?"}], "answer": "[True]. Bone morphogenetic protein 2 is a potent inducer of SMPC non-hypertrophic chondrogenesis, supporting the use of this combination for articular cartilage repair applications."}

However, there are no established predictors of clinical benefit. Pemetrexed inhibits multiple enzymes involved in pyrimidine and purine synthesis, but the main target is thymidylate synthase (TS). After cellular uptake pemetrexed is converted into more effective polyglutamated forms by folylpoly-\u03b3-glutamate synthetase (FPGS). We hypothesized that FPGS and TS protein expressions are associated with clinical outcome after pemetrexed-based chemotherapy.\nMETHODS: Pretreatment tumor samples from 84 patients with histologically confirmed MPM, who received pemetrexed combined with platinum (79 of 84) or single-agent pemetrexed (5 of 84) as first-line treatment, were retrospectively analyzed. FPGS and TS protein expressions were semiquantitatively assessed by using the Hybrid (H)-scoring system (range, 0-300). H-scores were correlated with radiological response according to modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).\nRESULTS: Median H-score of the entire cohort was 230 for FPGS (range, 100-300), and 210 for TS (range, 100-300).

In contrast, EGFR/PI3K/AKT signalling and recently the presence of so-called cancer stem cells are discussed as reasons for radioresistance.\nMETHODS: The study investigates mechanisms of apoptosis, key oncogenes of the PI3K/AKT pathway and the presence of cancer cells with stem cell properties during irradiation in two cell lines (PCI-9A, and PCI-15) of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. WST-1-tests, qRT-PCR, western blots and FACS analysis were performed for analysis.\nRESULTS: The two cell lines presented different degrees of cell death upon irradiation. The radiosensitive cell line PCI-9A showed increased apoptosis after irradiation measured by expressed cleaved caspases 3 and 7 while the radioresistant cell line PCI-15 upregulated antiapoptotic Survivin and BCL2A1 mRNA. Besides, increased PI3K/AKT- and ERK1/2-signalling was associated with radioresistance accompanied by loss of PTEN function through phosphorylation on S380. Blockade of pAKT increased radiation-induced cell death, and moreover, led to an upregulation of pMET in the radioresistant cell line. The percentage of ALDH-positive tumour cells was markedly decreased after irradiation in the radiosensitive cell line.\nQuestion: Does aKT and MET signalling mediate antiapoptotic radioresistance in head neck cancer cell lines?"}], "answer": "[True]. Functional apoptosis is mandatory for sensitivity to irradiation in head neck cancer cells. Upregulation of the AKT-pathway seems to be one reason for poor radioresponse. Activated MET may also predict radioresistance, possibly through ERK1/2 signalling. Moreover MET may indicate the presence of cancer stem cells facilitating radioresistance as shown by increased ALDH expression."}

Although MFs enhance tumorigenesis, they are neither mutagenic nor tumorigenic. The mechanism of their tumorigenic effect has not been elucidated.\nMETHODS: To investigate the effect of MFs on apoptosis in HL-60 cells, we exposed the cells to static MFs of 6 mT generated by a magnetic disk of known intensity. Apoptosis was triggered by the DNA topoisomerase I inhibitor, camptothecin (CPT). Activation of caspases in situ using the fluorochrome-labeled inhibitor (FLICA) method and determination of plasma membrane integrity by excluding propidium iodide (PI) were measured by both laser scanning cytometry (LSC) and flow cytometry (FC). LSC and FC identified cells at three sequential stages of their demise: early apoptosis (cells with activated caspases and PI negative); late apoptosis (cells with activated caspases but unable to exclude PI); secondary necrosis (cells with apoptotic morphology no longer stained with FLICA, not excluding PI).\nRESULTS: MF alone did not induce any apoptogenic or necrogenic effect. CPT exposure led to the sequential appearance of apoptotic cells. In the presence of CPT and MF, the overall proportion of cells undergoing apoptosis was not significantly changed. However, we consistently observed a significant increase in the frequency of late apoptotic/necrotic cells when compared with samples treated with CPT alone (P < 0.001), as well as a decrease in the percentage of early apoptotic cells (P = 0.013). The data obtained by FC and LSC were consistent with each other, showing a similar phenomenon.\nQuestion: Does exposure of cells to static magnetic field accelerate loss of integrity of plasma membrane during apoptosis?"}], "answer": "[True]. Whereas MF alone or with CPT did not affect overall cell viability, it accelerated the rate of cell transition from apoptosis to secondary necrosis after induction of apoptosis by the DNA-damaging agent, CPT.

When combined simultaneously, MC1568 significantly enhanced MGCD0103-induced growth arrest, cell death/apoptosis, and G2/M cell cycle arrest, while Tubastatin A only synergistically enhanced MGCD0103-induced growth arrest. Although MC1568 or Tubastatin A alone had no obvious effects on DNA DSBs and p21 expression, their combination with MGCD0103 resulted in cooperative induction of p21 in the cells.\nQuestion: Are class I and class II histone deacetylases potential therapeutic targets for treating pancreatic cancer?"}], "answer": "[True].

Children with cystic fibrosis (CF) are vulnerable to recurrent respiratory tract infections and azithromycin, a translation targeted antibiotic, is often used chronically to treat CF patients. No major clinical side effects were found with chronic treatment. However, mitochondrial function was not previously assessed. We evaluated oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in lymphocytes from children with CF receiving chronic azithromycin treatment using an improved ATP production assay.\nMETHODS: Enzymatic activities of respiratory chain complexes II-IV and ATP production were measured in lymphocytes.\nRESULTS: Relative to controls and to CF patients without azithromycin treatment, no significant difference in mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes II-IV was detected, and ATP production with pyruvate, glutamate and succinate, did not disclose any differences between the groups.\nQuestion: Is mitochondrial OXPHOS function unaffected by chronic azithromycin treatment?"}], "answer": "[True]. We suggest that chronic treatment with azithromycin does not significantly affect OXPHOS function."}

Donor rabbits underwent lung harvest after pulmonary arterial PGE1 injection and Euro-Collins preservation solution flush, and lungs were preserved for 18 hours at 4 degrees C. Group I lungs (n = 9) served as control subjects. Group II lungs (n = 9) were reperfused with whole blood that was first passed through a leukocyte-depleting filter. In group III (n = 9), DWH-146e was added to the blood reperfusate (25 microg/kg) immediately before reperfusion and was administered throughout the reperfusion period (1 microg/kg/min). All lungs were reperfused for 30 minutes.\nRESULTS: Arterial oxygenation in group II and group III was significantly higher than that of group I after 30 minutes of reperfusion (514.27 +/- 35.80 and 461.12 +/- 43.77 vs 91.41 +/- 20.58 mm Hg, p < .001).

The classic MBP isoforms are predominantly expressed in the oligodendrocytes of the CNS. The splice variants of the single MBP gene (Golli-MBP BG21 and J37) are widely expressed in the neurons and also in the immune cells. The relative contribution of the individual MMPs to the MBP cleavage is not known.\nRESULTS: To elucidate which MMP plays the primary role in cleaving MBP, we determined the efficiency of MMP-2, MMP-8, MMP-9, MMP-10, MMP-12, MT1-MMP, MT2-MMP, MT3-MMP, MT4-MMP, MT5-MMP and MT6-MMP in the cleavage of the MBP, BG21 and J37 isoforms in the in vitro cleavage reactions followed by mass-spectroscopy analysis of the cleavage fragments. As a result, we identified the MMP cleavage sites and the sequence of the resulting fragments. We determined that MBP, BG21 and J37 are highly sensitive to redundant MMP proteolysis. MT6-MMP (initially called leukolysin), however, was superior over all of the other MMPs in cleaving the MBP isoforms. Using the mixed lymphocyte culture assay, we demonstrated that MT6-MMP proteolysis of the MBP isoforms readily generated, with a near quantitative yield, the immunogenic N-terminal 1-15 MBP peptide. This peptide selectively stimulated the proliferation of the PGPR7.5 T cell clone isolated from mice with EAE and specific for the 1-15 MBP fragment presented in the MHC H-2(U) context.\nQuestion: Is matrix metalloproteinase proteolysis of the myelin basic protein isoforms a source of immunogenic peptides in autoimmune multiple sclerosis?"}], "answer": "[True]. In sum, our biochemical observations led us to hypothesize that MT6-MMP, which is activated by furin and associated with the lipid rafts, plays an important role in MS pathology and that MT6-MMP is a novel and promising drug target in MS especially when compared with other individual MMPs."}

DABE and CEMA were more effective co-initiators than DEPT. Although DC was not limited by co-initiator concentration, the absence of a co-initiator resulted in marked differences in light transmission and decreased DC throughout 40s irradiation with each LCU type.\nQuestion: Does photoinitiation chemistry affect light transmission and degree of conversion of curing experimental dental resin composites?"}], "answer": "[True]. The spectral range emitted from different types of LCU and absorption characteristics of the photoinitiator chemistry of light-activated resin-based composites play a critical role in the efficiency of polymerisation."}

We previously demonstrated increased L-type Ca channel current (ICa) in coronary smooth muscle cells (SMCs) of male swine compared with female swine. In male swine, endogenous testosterone increases ICa in SMCs through enhanced expression of the pore-forming \u03b11 subunit Cav1.2. Conversely, the role of sex hormones in female swine has not been previously investigated. Therefore, the purpose of the current study was to determine the effect of ovariectomy on L-type Ca channel activity and expression in female Yucatan miniature swine.\nMETHODS: Sexually mature female swine were obtained from a breeder and randomly assigned to intact female (IF; n = 5) and ovariectomized (OVX; n = 6) groups.\nRESULTS: Sensitivity to depolarization-induced contractions was increased by ovariectomy. Accordingly, L-type ICa was enhanced in OVX (-9.5 [0.6] pA/pF) versus IF (-4.5 [0.3] pA/pF) swine, although L-type Ca channel \u03b11 subunit (Cav1.2; \u03b11c) messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein expressions were unchanged. Of the L-type Ca channel \u03b2 subunits, \u03b21 (188 [31]) and \u03b22a (561 [79]) had higher mRNA expression levels (target/18S) than \u03b23 (9 [1]) and \u03b24 (2 [0.1]). Although \u03b22a, \u03b23, and \u03b24 mRNA and protein expressions were not different between groups, protein expression of the \u03b21 subunit (Cav\u03b21) was decreased in OVX swine compared with IF swine.\nQuestion: Does ovariectomy increase L-type calcium channel activity in porcine coronary smooth muscle?"}], "answer": "[True]. Endogenous female hormones inhibit L-type Ca channel activity in coronary SMCs potentially via the up-regulation of Cav\u03b21 subunit expression."}

The corticospinal tract (CST), for example, responds to a thoracic transection with the formation of an intraspinal detour circuit. The key step for the formation of the detour circuit is the sprouting of new CST collaterals in the cervical spinal cord that contact local interneurons. How individual collaterals are formed and refined over time is incompletely understood.\nRESULTS: We traced the hindlimb corticospinal tract at different timepoints after lesion to show that cervical collateral formation is initiated in the first 10 days. These collaterals can then persist for at least 24 weeks. Interestingly, both major and minor CST components contribute to the formation of persistent CST collaterals. We then developed an approach to label single CST collaterals based on viral gene transfer of the Cre recombinase to a small number of cortical projection neurons in Thy1-STP-YFP or Thy1-Brainbow mice. Reconstruction and analysis of single collaterals for up to 12 weeks after lesion revealed that CST remodeling evolves in 3 phases. Collateral growth is initiated in the first 10 days after lesion. Between 10 days and 3-4 weeks after lesion elongated and highly branched collaterals form in the gray matter, the complexity of which depends on the CST component they originate from. Finally, between 3-4 weeks and 12 weeks after lesion the size of CST collaterals remains largely unchanged, while the pattern of their contacts onto interneurons matures.\nQuestion: Do single collateral reconstructions reveal distinct phases of corticospinal remodeling after spinal cord injury?"}], "answer": "[True]. This study provides a comprehensive anatomical analysis of CST reorganization after injury and reveals that CST remodeling occurs in distinct phases. Our results and techniques should facilitate future efforts to unravel the mechanisms that govern CST remodeling and to promote functional recovery after spinal cord injury."}

Multiple doses of cold (4 degrees C) cardioplegic solution was administered antegradely in addition to topical cooling during ischemic arrest. Myocardial recovery and outcome measures were assessed by five clinical end points: (1) inotropic support, (2) echocardiographic assessment of ventricular function, (3) overall complication rate, (4) length of stay in the intensive care unit, and (5) 30-day survival. Multiple logistic regression and multivariate analysis of variance were used to investigate which of the following clinical determinants were contributory: (1) cardioplegia, (2) urgency of operation, (3) aortic crossclamp time, (4) age, and (5) cyanosis.

Ischemia-initiated arteriogenesis in the upper limb was augmented in Trx2-TG mice. Trx2-TG mice also showed significantly enhanced capillary formation and maturation in the lower limb. In nontransgenic limb, ischemia specifically induced a downregulation of Trx2 protein, leading to increased oxidative stress, ASK1 activation, and EC apoptosis. In contrast, Trx2-TG maintained a constitutive level of Trx2, reducing the ischemia-induced deleterious responses. We then defined the mechanism by which Trx2 increases angiogenesis using ECs isolated from Trx2-TG mice. Trx2-TG ECs showed increased NO and NO-dependent migration. In addition, these cells were more resistant to oxidative stress-induced activation of ASK1 signaling and apoptosis. Moreover, Trx2-augmented EC survival is NO-independent. To define the relative contributions of Trx2-increased NO and Trx2-reduced ASK1 apoptotic activity to angiogenesis in vivo, we examined Trx2 effects on ischemia-induced angiogenesis in eNOS-deficient mice. The eNOS deletion caused severe impairment in the functional flow recovery in response to ischemia. Trx2 expression in eNOS-KO mice still dramatically inhibited ischemia-induced ASK1 and EC apoptosis, leading to an enhanced functional flow recovery.\nQuestion: Does endothelial-specific expression of mitochondrial thioredoxin promote ischemia-mediated arteriogenesis and angiogenesis?"}], "answer": "[True].

In this study, we investigated whether, and how mechanistically, HG concentrations control ASC fate in patients with diabetes.\nMETHODS: ASCs from the visceral adipose tissue of non-diabetic (N-ASCs) and diabetic participants (D-ASCs), identified by surface markers, were counted and evaluated for ROS generation and stem cell properties. Their ability to release soluble factors was assessed by BioPlex analysis. To reproduce an in vitro diabetic glucose milieu, N-ASCs were cultured in HG (25 mmol/l) or normal glucose (NG) concentration (5 mmol/l), as control. ASC pluripotency was assessed by in vitro study. The p47(phox) NOX subunit, AKT and octamer-binding transcription factor 4 (OCT4; also known as POU5F1) were knocked down by small-interfering RNA technology. Stem-cell features were evaluated by sphere cluster formation.\nRESULTS: The ASC number was higher in diabetic patients than in non-diabetic controls. Production of OCT4 and NANOG, stem-cell-specific transcription factors, was upregulated in D-ASCs compared with N-ASCs. Moreover, we found that ROS production and AKT activation drove D-ASC, but not N-ASC, secretion. When N-ASCs were cultured in vitro in the presence of HG, they also expressed OCT4/NANOG and formed spheres. By knock-down of the p47(phox) NOX subunit, AKT and OCT4 we demonstrated that NOX-generated ROS and their downstream signals are crucial for HG-mediated ASC de-differentiation and proinflammatory cytokine production.\nQuestion: Does a diabetic milieu promote OCT4 and NANOG production in human visceral-derived adipose stem cells?"}], "answer": "[True].

Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) is and important inflammatory cytokine with diverse effects including the ability to increase vascular endothelial cell permeability and to alter the structure of the endothelial cell glycocalyx. We have previously shown that arteriolar sensitivity to vasoactive materials is influenced by a barrier property of the arteriolar endothelium, and here we test the hypothesis that TNF-alpha might increase intimal permeability and thereby increase the access of circulating arginine-vasopressin (AVP) to vascular smooth muscle. Our objective in the current work was to show that TNF-alpha-mediated modulation of intimal cell permeability may produce both quantitative and qualitative alterations in vascular reactivity to arginine-vasopressin.\nMETHODS: Hamster cheek pouch arterioles (approximately 65 microm, i.d.) were double-cannulated and perfused. [Arg8]-vasopressin was applied selectively to either the luminal or the adventitial surface of isolated cannulated arterioles. The reactivity of the arterioles to vasopressin was determined in the presence and absence of TNF-alpha (0.625 microg/mL; 1 hour).\nRESULTS: Adventially applied AVP induced a concentration-dependent vasoconstriction with a threshold of approximately 1 pM, and a maximal constriction at 10 nM. In contrast, luminally applied AVP induced a biphasic response, showing a modest vasodilation in the range of 1 to 100 pM, and constrictions at doses higher than 1 nM. Maximal constrictions were not obtained with luminal doses of AVP as high as 1 microM; (i.e., at doses 100-fold higher than those that produced maximal responses with adventitial application). Dilations induced by luminal application of AVP were significantly attenuated by 10 microM Nomega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), but were not altered by 10 microM indomethacin. After treatment with TNF-alpha, the concentration-response curve for luminally applied AVP showed a more pronounced constriction and the dilator component of the agonist was eliminated. There was no change in the reactivity to adventitially applied AVP or to adventitial applications of acetylcholine. Nonspecific increases in endothelial cell permeability induced by 3-[(3-chloroamino-dopropyl)-dimethylamino]-1-propanesulfonate (CHAPS) also eliminated the potency differences between luminal and adventitial drug application. Following TNF-alpha treatment and loss of the dilator component of the response to AVP, L-NAME was still capable of reducing the arteriolar sensitivity to ACh, thus showing that the endothelial cell machinery for NO production was intact following TNF-alpha treatment.\nQuestion: Does tNF-alpha modulate arteriolar reactivity secondary to a change in intimal permeability?"}], "answer": "[True]. Our findings show that the reactivity of intact resistance vessels to agonists that have both endothelial-dependent and smooth muscle cell-dependent components will be complex. Reactivity is the summation of: 1) the relative sensitivities of smooth muscle and endothelial cells to AVP, 2) the release of nitric oxide or other mediators from endothelium, and 3) the restricted access of intraluminal AVP to arteriolar smooth muscle cells. Thus, cytokines, and perhaps other materials that regulate endothelial cell permeability, can modify arteriolar reactivity by altering transendothelial cell access of luminal stimuli to the smooth muscle cells, as well as by acting directly on smooth muscle or by influencing the production of endothelial cell-derived vasoactive materials. In the case of agonists that have an endothelial cell dilator component as well as a smooth muscle constrictor component, this may result in a qualitative change in response as is shown here with AVP."}

Dusp8 gene-deleted mice were mildly hypercontractile at baseline with a cardiac phenotype of concentric ventricular remodeling, which protected them from progressing towards heart failure in 2 surgery-induced disease models. Cardiac-specific overexpression of DUSP8 produced spontaneous eccentric remodeling and ventricular dilation with heart failure. At the cellular level, adult cardiac myocytes from Dusp8 gene-deleted mice were thicker and shorter, whereas DUSP8 overexpression promoted cardiac myocyte lengthening with a loss of thickness. Mechanistically, activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 were selectively increased in Dusp8 gene-deleted hearts at baseline and following acute pathological stress stimulation, whereas p38 MAPK and c-Jun N-terminal kinases were mostly unaffected.\nQuestion: Does dUSP8 regulate Cardiac Ventricular Remodeling by Altering ERK1/2 Signaling?"}], "answer": "[True].

Reduced slow inward Ca2+ current and sarcoplasmic reticular effects on intracellular Ca2+ are likely involved. The authors reported previously that halothane protects against hypoxic and ischemia reperfusion injury in isolated hearts. The aim of this isolated heart study was to compare protective effects of halothane and low CaCl2 (0.5 mM) administered during 1 day of hypothermic perfusion on return of normothermic perfusion.\nMETHODS: Guinea pig hearts (n = 66) were isolated and perfused at 37 degrees C with a Krebs' solution, gassed with 96% O2, 4% CO2, and containing 2.5 mM Ca2+, and 4.5 mM K+. Heart rate, isovolumetric left ventricular pressure, coronary flow, %O2 extraction, O2 consumption rate, and relative cardiac efficiency (EFF = heart rate.left ventricular pressure/O2 consumption rate) were measured in five groups of hearts: time controls (no hypothermia); 1.5, and 3% halothane delivered by vaporizer; cold controls (hypothermia only); and 0.5 mM CaCl2. Halothane was administered, or CaCl2 was decreased 0.5 h before hypothermia at 3.8 +/- 0.1 degrees C, during hypothermia for 22 h, and for 0.5 h after rewarming to 37.0 +/- 0.1 degrees C. Hearts were perfused at 25% of initial coronary flow during hypothermia.\nRESULTS: All groups had similar ventricular function and vasodilator responses before hypothermia. During normothermic reperfusion after hypothermia, both concentrations of halothane protected better than low CaCl2. Values, expressed as a percent of initial values in the five groups (time control, 3% halothane, 1.5% halothane, cold control, and 0.5 mM CaCl2, were respectively: 90 +/- 6, 54 +/- 6*, 48 +/- 5*, 27 +/- 8, 27 +/- 4% for left ventricular pressure; 84 +/- 5, 61 +/- 4*, 62 +/- 6*, 40 +/- 5, 34 +/- 5% for EFF; and 102 +/- 3, 63 +/- 3*, 66 +/- 3*, 55 +/- 2, 42 +/- 2% for coronary flow (*P < 0.05 halothane vs. 0.5 mM CaCl2). The coronary flow response to endothelium-dependent (acetylcholine) and endothelium-independent (nitroprusside) vasodilators was also greater after halothane than after 0.5 mM CaCl2.\nQuestion: Does one-day hypothermic preservation of isolated hearts with halothane improve cardiac function better than low calcium?"}], "answer": "[True]. Halothane administered during hypothermia restores left ventricular pressure, cardiac efficiency, basal coronary flow, and flow responses better than low CaCl2. Although halothane and low CaCl2 both reduce intracellular Ca2+, contractile force, and metabolic demand, the better protective effect of halothane is not likely simply due to a reduction in contractile function and metabolic rate before or initially after hypothermia because these were reduced much more by low CaCl2 than by halothane."}

Recent studies have demonstrated that NGAL is up-regulated in cardiomyocytes within the failing myocardium.

In the chronic HF cohort, higher plasma NGAL levels were modestly associated with increasing age (r = 0.18; P = .035), higher New York Heart Association functional class (rank sums: P = .022) and impaired renal function (eGFR: r = -0.53; P < .0001; cystatin C: r = 0.60; P < .0001).

Microdosimetric methods using a tissue-equivalent proportional counter have been used to measure the neutron and gamma doses for the cell irradiation. Previous data for a cell line exposed in vitro suggested that neutrons did not produce bystander effects at doses below 300 mGy.

Fish were either exposed directly to the beam or were allowed to swim with or in water previously occupied by irradiated fish.\nRESULTS: Using the zebrafish model it was found that there was significant direct cell death seen both by apoptosis scores and clonogenic assay when the neutron dose was approximately 100 mGy.

Finally, bacterial clearance was significantly greater in MSC-treated mice, in part due to enhanced phagocytotic activity of the host immune cells.\nQuestion: Do mesenchymal stem cells reduce inflammation while enhancing bacterial clearance and improving survival in sepsis?"}], "answer": "[True]. These data demonstrate that MSCs have beneficial effects on experimental sepsis, possibly by paracrine mechanisms, and suggest that immunomodulatory cell therapy may be an effective adjunctive treatment to reduce sepsis-related morbidity and mortality."}

ANT has been known to be a major component of the permeability transition pore complex of mitochondria and contributes to mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. Human ANT has four isoforms (ANT1, ANT2, ANT3, and ANT4), and the expression of the ANT isoforms is variable depending on the tissue and cell type, developmental stage, and proliferation status. Among the isoforms, ANT1 is highly expressed in terminally-differentiated tissues, but expressed in low levels in proliferating cells, such as cancer cells. In particular, over-expression of ANT1 induces apoptosis in cultured tumor cells.\nMETHODS: We applied an ANT1 gene transfer approach to induce apoptosis and to evaluate the anti-tumor effect of ANT1 in a nude mouse model.\nRESULTS: We demonstrated that ANT1 transfection induced apoptosis of MDA-MB-231 cells, inactivated NF-kappaB activity, and increased Bax expression. ANT1-inducing apoptosis was accompanied by the disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential, cytochrome c release and the activation of caspases-9 and -3. Moreover, ANT1 transfection significantly suppressed tumor growth in vivo.\nQuestion: Does over-expression of adenine nucleotide translocase 1 ( ANT1 ) induce apoptosis and tumor regression in vivo?"}], "answer": "[True].

Curcumin dose-dependently decreased plasma lipids and glucose and the dose 150 mg/kg BW appeared to be adequate to produce a significant effect. Curcumin supplementation reduced glucose and insulin tolerance measured as areas under the curve. L6 myotubes were treated with palmitate (0.25 mmol/L) in the presence of different levels of curcumin for 24 h in our in vitro experiment.

Leptin circulates in blood and acts on the brain, which sends downstream signals to regulate body weight. Leptin therapy has been successful in treating leptin deficient obese patients. However, high levels of leptin have been observed in more common forms of obesity indicating a state of leptin resistance which limits the application of leptin in the treatment of obesity. If the central effect of leptin could be by-passed and genes which respond to leptin treatment could be regulated directly, new therapeutic targets for the treatment of obesity may be possible. The purpose of this study was to identify genes and subsequent pathways correlated with leptin-mediated weight loss.\nRESULTS: WE UTILIZED MICROARRAY TECHNOLOGY TO COMPARE HEPATIC GENE EXPRESSION CHANGES AFTER TWO TYPES OF LEPTIN ADMINISTRATION: one involving a direct stimulatory effect when administered peripherally (subcutaneous: SQ) and another that is indirect, involving a hypothalamic relay that suppresses food intake when leptin is administered centrally (intracerebroventricular: ICV). We identified 214 genes that correlate with leptin mediated weight loss. Several biological processes such as mitochondrial metabolic pathways, lipid metabolic and catabolic processes, lipid biosynthetic processes, carboxylic acid metabolic processes, iron ion binding and glutathione S-transferases were downregulated after leptin administration. In contrast, genes involved in the immune system inflammatory response and lysosomal activity were found to be upregulated.

In this study we have identified key molecular pathways and downstream genes which respond to leptin treatment and are involved in leptin-mediated weight loss.

Further investigation will be required to assess the possible use of these genes and their associated protein products as therapeutic targets for the treatment of obesity."}

Recently, a Bax microsatellite mutation was uncovered in combination with a specific alternative splicing event that could generate a unique Bax isoform (Bax\u03942) in otherwise Bax-negative cells. Like the prototype Bax\u03b1, Bax\u03942 is a potent proapoptotic molecule. However, the proapoptotic mechanism and therapeutic implication of Bax\u03942 remain elusive. Here, the isolation and analysis of isogenic subcell lines are described that represent different Bax microsatellite statuses from colorectal cancer. Colon cancer cells harboring Bax microsatellite G7/G7 alleles are capable of producing low levels of endogenous Bax\u03942 transcripts and proteins. Interestingly, Bax\u03942-positive cells are selectively sensitive to a subgroup of chemotherapeutics compared with Bax\u03942-negative cells. Unlike other Bax isoforms, Bax\u03942 recruits caspase-8 into the proximity for activation, and the latter, in turn, activates caspase-3 and apoptosis independent of the mitochondrial pathway. These data suggest that the expression of Bax\u03942 may provide alternative apoptotic and chemotherapeutic advantages for Bax-negative tumors.\nQuestion: Does bax\u03942 promote apoptosis through caspase-8 activation in microsatellite-unstable colon cancer?"}], "answer": "[True]. \"Bax-negative\" colorectal tumors expressing a Bax isoform are sensitive to selective chemotherapeutics."}

Whereas constitutively expressed leukocyte L-selectin/CD62L and endothelial P-selectin/CD62P together with CD44 and P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1/CD162 initiate the emigration of neutrophils, de novo synthesis of endothelial E-selectin/CD62E launches the delayed secondary recruitment of inflammatory monocytes. In this context, P-selectin/CD62P and L-selectin/CD62L together with P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1/CD162 and CD44 were found to regulate the flux of rolling neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes, whereas E-selectin/CD62E selectively adjusts the rolling velocity of inflammatory monocytes. Moreover, selectins and their interaction partners P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1/CD162 and CD44 differentially control the intraluminal crawling behavior of neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes collectively enabling the sequential extravasation of these immune cells to inflamed tissue.\nQuestion: Do spatiotemporal expression dynamics of selectins govern the sequential extravasation of neutrophils and monocytes in the acute inflammatory response?"}], "answer": "[True]. Our findings provide novel insights into the mechanisms initiating the sequential infiltration of the perivascular tissue by neutrophils and monocytes in the acute inflammatory response and might thereby contribute to the development of targeted therapeutic strategies for prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases."}

Phenotype analysis was performed at different time points and expression levels of transcription factors (TFs) and cytokine receptors were measured quantitatively and kinetically.\nRESULTS: After 3 days in vitro culture, ONP cells differentiated into two populations: B220(-)CD11b(-) and B220(-)CD11b(+) cells. B220(-)CD11b(-) cells can further differentiate into B lineage cells only with the support of B220(-)CD11b(+) cells. Cells exposed to 100 mM of alcohol during the first 3 days of culture showed no statistically significant difference in B cell formation after 12 days compared with the control group.

The syndrome is characterized by amenorrhoea, oestrogen deficiency and elevated levels of gonadotrophins. Autoimmunity has been proposed as a mechanism for some cases of destruction or malfunction of ovarian follicles. POF is often associated with type I and type II polyglandular autoimmune syndromes. It has also been postulated that receptors such as the LH and FSH receptors might become targets for blocking antibodies and such antibodies could be a cause of ovarian failure.\nMETHODS: Sixty-nine patients with POF isolated or associated with other endocrine autoimmune diseases (autoimmune thyroid diseases, Addison's disease, type 1 diabetes mellitus, multiple sclerosis, myasthenia gravis) were studied. All the patients had secondary amenorrhoea. The patient group had a median age of 33.1 years (range 15-57). Ovarian failure had been diagnosed at a median age of 29 years (range 15-39). The median time since diagnosis was almost 1 year but in six patients gonadal insufficiency had appeared 10-30 years earlier. All had a normal chromosomal karyotype (46, XX). Patients with POF were characterized by duration of amenorrhoea > 1 year, with elevated FSH and LH levels and undetectable or low oestrogen levels. Cell lines stably expressing recombinant human LH (CHO-LHr) and FSH (CHO-FSHr) receptors were prepared and used to search for antibodies able to inhibit LH- or FSH-stimulated cAMP production. Immunoglobulins extracted from sera of patients with POF were incubated with CHO-LHr and CHO-FSHr in the presence of human recombinant CG and FSH, respectively.\nQuestion: Are gonadotrophin receptor blocking antibodies measured by the use of cell lines stably expressing human gonadotrophin receptors detectable in women with 46 , XX premature ovarian failure?"}], "answer": "[False]. None of the immunoglobulin G (IgG) preparations from patients with POF was able to inhibit the activity of the FSH- and CG-stimulated cAMP production."}

The total and minority-level prevalence of TDR by demographic characteristics was compared.\nRESULTS: Sensitive screening identified 72% more TDR than conventional sequencing for the five mutations assessed (13.6 vs. 7.9%, P\u200a<\u200a0.0001), with K65R having the greatest increase (0-1.7%). One-third of K65R was in persons who also had at least one of the other mutations screened.

A significant proportion of TDR, primarily in older, white MSM, was undetected by conventional testing. The greatest underestimation was for rapid-decaying mutations typically associated with the source virus having recent exposure to antiretroviral therapy. However, total TDR prevalence was highest in the less than 20-year age group who were predominantly black, underscoring the importance of prevention efforts for at-risk youth."}

There is an unmet need for better treatment strategy for estrogen-deficiency-related cardiovascular complications. Here we investigated the impact of chronic black tea extract (BT) consumption on cardiovascular function and lipid metabolism using a rat model of estrogen deficiency.\nMETHODS: Female Sprague-Dawley rats were ovariectomized (OVX) and treated with BT (15\u00a0mg/kg/day, 4\u00a0weeks; active ingredients: theaflavins) or estrogen (E2) treatment for 4\u00a0weeks. Serum was collected for measuring cholesterol, triacylglycerol and estradiol levels. Changes in vascular reactivity were examined. The protein levels of NADPH oxidases were assessed by Western blotting. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) level was measured using dihydroethidium fluorescence imaging. The concentrations of cGMP were measured using ELISA kit.\nRESULTS: Aortic rings from control, BT-treated and E2-treated OVX rats exhibited a greater increase in Phe-induced contraction after inhibition of NO synthase compared with those from OVX rats. ACh-induced endothelium-dependent relaxations were augmented in aortae and renal arteries in BT/E2-treated OVX rats than in OVX rats. BT/E2 treatment improved flow-mediated dilatation in small mesenteric resistance arteries of OVX rats. BT/E2 treatment restored the eNOS phosphorylation level and reversed the up-regulation of NADPH oxidases and ROS overproduction in OVX rat aortae. ACh-stimulated cGMP production was significantly elevated in the aortae from BT- and E2-treated rats compared with those from OVX rats. BT/E2 treatment reduced circulating levels of total cholesterol.\nQuestion: Does chronic black tea extract consumption improve endothelial function in ovariectomized rats?"}], "answer": "[True].

A variety of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria produce large quantities of indole that functions as an intercellular signal controlling diverse aspects of bacterial physiology.\nRESULTS: In this study, we sought a novel role of indole in a gram-positive bacteria Paenibacillus alvei that can produce extracellular indole at a concentration of up to 300 \u03bcM in the stationary phase in Luria-Bertani medium. Unlike previous studies, our data show that the production of indole in P. alvei is strictly controlled by catabolite repression since the addition of glucose and glycerol completely turns off the indole production. The addition of exogenous indole markedly inhibits the heat resistance of P. alvei without affecting cell growth. Observation of cell morphology with electron microscopy shows that indole inhibits the development of spore coats and cortex in P. alvei. As a result of the immature spore formation of P. alvei, indole also decreases P. alvei survival when exposed to antibiotics, low pH, and ethanol. Additionally, indole derivatives also influence the heat resistance; for example, a plant auxin, 3-indolylacetonitrile dramatically (2900-fold) decreased the heat resistance of P. alvei, while another auxin 3-indoleacetic acid had a less significant influence on the heat resistance of P. alvei.\nQuestion: Do indole and 3-indolylacetonitrile inhibit spore maturation in Paenibacillus alvei?"}], "answer": "[True]. Together, our results demonstrate that indole and plant auxin 3-indolylacetonitrile inhibit spore maturation of P. alvei and that 3-indolylacetonitrile presents an opportunity for the control of heat and antimicrobial resistant spores of gram-positive bacteria."}

Chemo-sensitizing or radio-sensitizing effect was analyzed by tetrazolium-based colorimetric assay and flow cytometry. Western blot analysis, confocal microscopy, gene silencing with siRNA transfection and luciferase reporter gene assay were performed to examine signaling molecule activation.\nRESULTS: Among the tested flavonoid compounds, pretreatment of the cells with xanthohumol significantly sensitized MCF-7/ADR cells to the radiation treatment by inducing apoptosis. In MCF-7/ADR cells, treatment with xanthohumol alone or with gamma-rays significantly decreased levels of anti-apoptotic proteins. Multi-drug resistance 1 (MDR1), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) expression levels in MCF-7/ADR cells were suppressed by xanthohumol treatment.

There may be shared pathophysiological pathways between cerebral and myocardial dysfunction that impact on apoptosis related proteins. Our aim was to examine behaviour changes of rats with chronic mild stress (CMS), explore the expression of Bax and Bcl-xl in the hippocampus and myocardium, and additionally evaluate the effects of venlafaxine on these molecular mechanisms.\nMETHODS: Rats were randomly divided into three groups. The behaviour was assessed using the open field and sucrose consumption tests. Gene expression was measured by RT-PCR.\nRESULTS: In CMS, there was a significant reduction of movements and sucrose consumption, an increased Bax level and a decreased Bcl-xl level in both the hippocampus and myocardium. The venlafaxine group showed an increase in movements and sucrose consumption, as well as upregulated expression of Bcl-xl and downregulated expression of Bax in both the hippocampus and myocardium.\nQuestion: Does venlafaxine modulate depression-induced behaviour and the expression of Bax mRNA and Bcl-xl mRNA in both hippocampus and myocardium?"}], "answer": "[True].

Aortic stiffness was assessed by measurement of carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV).\nRESULTS: Carotid-femoral PWV, adjusted for age and mean arterial pressure (MAP), was higher in subjects with MAU (n = 41) than in those without it (n = 99) (11.6 +/- 2.3 vs. 9.9 +/- 1.8 m/s; P < 0.001) and in subjects with hsCRP above the median value when compared to those with lower levels of hsCRP (10.8 +/- 2.1 vs. 10 +/- 2.1 m/s; P = 0.026). In multiple regression analysis, AER and hsCPR remained independent predictors of aortic stiffness (beta = 0.24; P < 0.001 and beta = 0.15; P = 0.03, respectively).\nQuestion: Is the association of microalbuminuria with aortic stiffness independent of C-reactive protein in essential hypertension?"}], "answer": "[True].

Subsequently, both groups lever pressed for the stimulus with contingent nicotine, non-contingent nicotine (0.06 mg kg(-1) per infusion, freebase), or non-contingent saline, according to fixed ratio and progressive ratio reinforcement schedules.\nRESULTS: Compared to sucrose-unpaired training, repeated association with sucrose established the light-tone stimulus as a robust conditioned reinforcer. Contingent and non-contingent nicotine equally elevated responding for this conditioned stimulus. Conversely, for the less reinforcing (sucrose-unpaired) stimulus contingent nicotine more effectively elevated behavior compared to non-contingent nicotine.\nQuestion: Is operant responding for conditioned and unconditioned reinforcers in rats differentially enhanced by the primary reinforcing and reinforcement-enhancing effects of nicotine?"}], "answer": "[True]. The reinforcement-enhancing effect of nicotine increases behavior controlled by both conditioned and unconditioned reinforcers; however, for less salient stimuli associative processes derived from the primary reinforcing effects of contingent nicotine may also be important.

Rats treated with a lithium-containing diet were used to examine the in vivo effect of the drug on brain protein phosphatase activity.RESULTS. Lithium stimulated protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTPase) activity in a dose- and time-dependent manner in PC12 cells. A maximal stimulation of 87% was observed after 6 h of incubation with 3 mM LiCl. In contrast, protein serine phosphatase (PSPase) activity was not changed by lithium. The stimulatory effect on PTPase was not due to a direct action of the ion on the enzymes, but its selectivity was noted since treatment of cells with other monovalent cations exhibited no effect on PTPase activity. Lithium appeared to target specific PTPase(s) as it stimulated membrane-associated PTPase activity without affecting cytosolic or nuclear enzymatic activities. Moreover, the stimulation of PTPase activity in PC12 cells by lithium is independent of de novo protein synthesis. In the rat, 3 weeks of lithium treatment significantly elevated PTPase activity in hippocampus, striatum and cortex.\nQuestion: Does lithium regulate protein tyrosine phosphatase activity in vitro and in vivo?"}], "answer": "[True].

This paper asks what ordinary Russians really think about possible actions to reduce smoking.\nMETHODS: A representative sample of the Russian population (1600 respondents) was interviewed face to face in November 2007.\nRESULTS: Only 14% of respondents considered tobacco control in Russia adequate, while 37% thought that nothing was being done at all. There was support for prices keeping pace with or even exceeding inflation. Over 70% of all respondents favoured a ban on sales from street kiosks, while 56% believed that existing health warnings (currently 4% of front and back of packs) were inadequate. The current policy of designating a few tables in bars and restaurants as non-smoking was supported by less than 10% of respondents, while almost a third supported a total ban, with 44% supporting provision of equal space for smokers and non-smokers. Older age, non-smoking status and living in a smaller town all emerged as significantly associated with the propensity to support antismoking measures. The tobacco companies were generally viewed as behaving like most other companies in Russia, with three-quarters of respondents believing that these companies definitely or maybe bribe politicians.

In response to limitation of specific carbohydrates, cAMP and its receptor CRP control the transcription of genes important for nutrient acquisition and utilization; c-di-GMP controls the transition between motile and sessile lifestyles often, but not exclusively, through transcriptional mechanisms. In this study, we investigated the convergence of cAMP and c-di-GMP signaling pathways in regulating the expression of gbpA. GbpA is a colonization factor that participates in the attachment of V. cholerae to N-acetylglucosamine-containing surfaces in its native aquatic environment and the host intestinal tract.\nRESULTS: We show that c-di-GMP inhibits gbpA activation in a fashion independent of the known transcription factors that directly sense c-di-GMP. Interestingly, inhibition of gbpA activation by c-di-GMP only occurs during growth on non-PTS dependent nutrient sources. Consistent with this result, we show that CRP binds to the gbpA promoter in a cAMP-dependent manner in vitro and drives transcription of gbpA in vivo. The interplay between cAMP and c-di-GMP does not broadly impact the CRP-cAMP regulon, but occurs more specifically at the gbpA promoter.\nQuestion: Do two nucleotide second messengers regulate the production of the Vibrio cholerae colonization factor GbpA?"}], "answer": "[True]. These findings suggest that c-di-GMP directly interferes with the interaction of CRP-cAMP and the gbpA promoter via an unidentified regulator.

Furthermore, these cardioprotective effects in the hSCF/tTA mice were abrogated by doxycycline, which turned off hSCF overexpression, and by a PI3 kinase inhibitor LY294002. Myocardial expression of insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), which are upstream activators of Akt signaling, was significantly increased in hSCF/tTA compared to WT mice after I/R (P<0.05), and was associated with higher number of c-kit(+) cardiac stem cells (CSCs) (P<0.05). Inhibition of c-kit signaling by ACK2 treatment abolished these protective effects in hSCF/tTA mice.\nQuestion: Does cardiomyocyte-specific overexpression of human stem cell factor protect against myocardial ischemia and reperfusion injury?"}], "answer": "[True]. Cardiomyocyte-specific overexpression of hSCF protects the heart from I/R injury. The cardioprotective effects of hSCF overexpression are mediated by increased c-kit(+) CSCs, enhanced growth factor expression and activation of Akt signaling pathway."}

We hypothesized that IgE(+) basophils were hyperreleasable.\nOBJECTIVE: Deficiencies in early signal transduction events associated with Fc(epsilon)RI lead to a nonreleasable phenotype, whereas the Src homology 2 domain--containing inositol 5' phosphatase (SHIP) knockout mice have hyperreleasable mast cells. The purpose of this study was to ascertain whether a difference in intracellular signaling molecules could explain the hyperreleasable phenotype of human IgE(+) basophils.\nMETHODS: Basophils were purified by means of double Percoll gradients and negative selection with magnetic beads. Cell lysates were Western blotted for the tyrosine kinases Lyn and Syk and the phosphatase SHIP. Additionally, histamine release to HrHRF was performed in addition to real-time RT-PCR to investigate mRNA for SHIP.\nRESULTS: We show a striking negative correlation between the amount of SHIP protein per cell equivalent, but not Lyn or Syk, and maximum histamine release to HrHRF. This deficiency of SHIP was observed in basophils, but not lymphocytes or monocytes, of these IgE(+) donors. Additionally, levels of mRNA for SHIP did not differ between IgE(+) and IgE(-) donor basophils, which is consistent with a posttranscriptional mechanism of protein regulation. SHIP and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase reciprocally regulate phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5) triphosphate levels. We also demonstrated that Ly294002, the phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase inhibitor, prevented HrHRF-induced histamine release in IgE(+) donor basophils.\nQuestion: Is src homology 2 domain-containing inositol 5 ' phosphatase negatively associated with histamine release to human recombinant histamine-releasing factor in human basophils?"}], "answer": "[True].

DNA was extracted from paraffin-embedded tumor tissue after microdissection, and methylation-specific PCR and capillary-array electrophoresis analysis were performed.\nRESULTS: In early stages of tumor progression (T1 and N0), RASSF1A and CCND2 were significantly (P < 0.05) more methylated in ER-positive than in ER-negative tumors. GSTP1 hypermethylation was more frequent in the lymph node metastasis positive group than in the negative group. Double negative (ER-negative, HER2/neu-negative) breast cancers had significantly lesser frequencies of RASSF1A, GSTP1, and APC methylation (P < 0.0001, P < 0.0001, and P = 0.0035, respectively). Both ER and HER2/neu status correlated independently with these epigenetic alterations.\nQuestion: Do estrogen receptor and HER2/neu status affect epigenetic differences of tumor-related genes in primary breast tumors?"}], "answer": "[True]. We demonstrated significant differences in tumor-related gene methylation patterns relevant to ER and HER2/neu status of breast tumors. This may be of significance in the assessment of targeted therapy resistance related to ER and HER2/neu status in breast cancer patients."}

Visualization of the fat pad allows anticipation of complete release of the TCL without unnecessary distal dissection that could risk iatrogenic injury. This study defines the anatomic relationship of the distal edge of the TCL to the fat pad, the superficial palmar arch, and the motor branch of the median nerve.\nMETHODS: Eighteen fresh-frozen cadaver hands were dissected, and the proximal aspect of the palmar fat pad, the distal edge of the TCL, the superficial palmar arch, and the motor branch of the median nerve were identified. An electronic caliper was used to measure distances between each structure along the axis of the radial border of the ring finger. A subset of 8 hands was radiographically imaged with fingers flexed and extended (wrist neutral) to determine if finger positioning influenced measurements between marked structures.\nRESULTS: The proximal aspect of the palmar fat pad is 2.0 mm proximal to the distal edge of the TCL. The distal end of the TCL, as measured along the axis of the radial border of the ring finger is 12.7 mm from the most proximal aspect of the palmar arch and 6.5 mm from the nearest aspect of the motor branch. Flexing the fingers decreases the distance between the distal end of the TCL and the fat pad while not markedly affecting the distance between the TCL and the palmar arch or the motor branch.\nQuestion: Is the palmar fat pad a reliable intraoperative landmark during carpal tunnel release?"}], "answer": "[True]. The palmar fat pad is a reliable anatomic landmark during carpal tunnel release. When dividing the TCL from proximal to distal, visualization of the proximal aspect of the fat pad indicates that the distal edge of the TCL is within approximately 2 mm and indicates that distal dissection beyond this extent is unnecessary."}

Alternative strategies for managing postoperative pain are expensive, cumbersome, and also have their own risks. While long-term use of celecoxib has been associated with an increased risk of serious adverse cardiovascular effects, no problems have been reported with short-term use.\nOBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine whether the addition of celecoxib, a selective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory, to an analgesic regimen reduced narcotic use and pain following augmentation mammaplasty.\nMETHODS: One hundred patients underwent submuscular augmentation mammaplasty with smooth saline-filled mammary prostheses using an intravenous sedation technique. Group A (N = 50) used hydrocodone to manage postoperative pain. Group B (N = 50) used celecoxib 400 mg 1 to 2 hours before surgery and then daily in addition to hydrocodone postoperatively. Narcotic use, incidence of nausea, and complications were recorded. Pain was assessed daily with a Likert pain scale from 0 (no pain) to 10 (severe pain).\nRESULTS: Group A used 110 +/- 34 mg hydrocodone during the immediate 7-day postoperative period and reported an average pain scale score of 5.1. Group B, which used celecoxib, used 34 +/- 22 mg hydrocodone during the same period with an average pain scale score of 3.3. These differences were statistically significant (P < .05). Group B experienced 53% less nausea than Group A. There were no significant differences between the groups regarding age, implant size, or complications.\nQuestion: Does celecoxib reduce narcotic use and pain following augmentation mammaplasty?"}], "answer": "[True]. Perioperative celecoxib administration in patients undergoing augmentation mammaplasty significantly reduced postoperative narcotic use, pain, and nausea.

This correlation of UnBiological with toxicity is stronger for low potency (millimolar) toxins. I relate this to the observation that most chemicals interact with many biological structures at low millimolar toxicity.

The chemistry of life has to form a dense, self-consistent network of chemical structures, and cannot easily be arbitrarily extended. The toxicity of arbitrary chemicals is a reflection of the disruption to that network occasioned by trying to insert a chemical into it without also selecting all the other components to tolerate that chemical. This suggests new ways to test for the toxicity of chemicals, and that engineering organisms to make high concentrations of materials such as chemical precursors or fuels may require more substantial engineering than just of the synthetic pathways involved."}

In multiple variable linear regression models adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, and opioid use, the following associations retained statistical significance; isokinetic knee extensor strength at 60\u00b0/s (P=0.020) and 180\u00b0/s (P=0.003), isokinetic knee flexor strength at 60\u00b0/s (P=0.015) and 180\u00b0/s (P=0.001), and peak VO2 uptake (P=0.014). However, no significant associations were found between pain severity and isometric knee extensor strength.\nQuestion: Is pain severity associated with muscle strength and peak oxygen uptake in adults with fibromyalgia?"}], "answer": "[True]. The main findings from this study were that lesser values of isokinetic knee strength and peak VO2 uptake were predictive of greater pain severity scores. These results build on the findings of previous investigations, but ongoing research is needed to further characterize the effects of strength and peak VO2 uptake on the pathophysiology of FM."}

Electrophysiological studies indicate that phencyclidine (PCP) markedly disrupts neuronal activity with an overall excitatory effect and reduces the power of low-frequency oscillations (LFO; <4 Hz) in thalamocortical networks. Because the reticular nucleus of the thalamus (RtN) provides tonic feed-forward inhibition to the rest of the thalamic nuclei, we examined the effect of PCP on RtN activity, under the working hypothesis that NMDA-R blockade in RtN would disinhibit thalamocortical networks.\nMETHODS: Drug effects (PCP followed by clozapine) on the activity of RtN (single unit and local field potential recordings) and prefrontal cortex (PFC; electrocorticogram) in anesthetized rats were assessed.\nRESULTS: PCP (.25-.5 mg/kg, intravenous) reduced the discharge rate of 19 of 21 RtN neurons to 37% of baseline (p < .000001) and the power of LFO in RtN and PFC to ~20% of baseline (p < .001).

In vivo experiments were carried out to identify modulation of Notch signaling in BM endothelial and hematopoietic cells in mice challenged with tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS), or in Tie2-tmTNF-alpha transgenic mice characterized by constitutive TNF-alpha activation.\nRESULTS: BM endothelial cells were found to express Jagged ligands and to greatly support progenitor's colony-forming ability. This effect was markedly decreased by Notch antagonists and augmented by increasing levels of Jagged2. Physiologic upregulation of Jagged2 expression on BMEC was observed upon TNF-alpha activation. Injection of TNF-alpha or LPS upregulated three- to fourfold Jagged2 expression on murine BM endothelial cells in vivo and resulted in increased Notch activation on murine hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. Similarly, constitutive activation of endothelial cells in Tie2-tmTNF-alpha mice was characterized by increased expression of Jagged2 and by augmented Notch activation on hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells.\nQuestion: Do tumor necrosis factor-alpha and endothelial cells modulate Notch signaling in the bone marrow microenvironment during inflammation?"}], "answer": "[True].

A second experiment covered two frequencies (7 and 21 rev/s) at five contrast levels from 25 to 100%, in a large field (27 degrees x 32 degrees) and a perifoveal condition (central mask of 7.5 degrees radius).\nRESULTS: Experiment 1: At all temporal frequencies the PERG amplitude increases with contrast, but the shape of the contrast-amplitude function varies markedly: Under transient conditions and at 7 rev/s, the PERG increases linearly with contrast, but this function displays a progressively positive curvature at higher frequencies (P < 0.001). At 21 rev/s a reduction of the contrast from 100% to 50% reduces the amplitude to 1/5. Experiment 2: Experiment 1 was replicated. The amplitude-contrast characteristic was found to be linear at 7 rev/s and smoothly accelerating at 21 rev/s; the same characteristics were found when stimulating the perifoveal area alone.\nQuestion: Does the contrast characteristic of the pattern electroretinogram depend on temporal frequency?"}], "answer": "[True]. This dependency of the contrast characteristic on temporal frequency is contrary to what would be expected from a magno/parvo model. Further, this contrast dependency needs to be taken into account when designing stimuli for use in patients that may have media opacities."}

Before treatment with PB, average seizure frequency in PB nonresponders was significantly higher than seizure frequency in responders, which, however, was due to six nonresponders that exhibited > 3 seizures per day. Such high seizure frequency was not observed in responders, demonstrating that high seizure frequency predicts pharmacoresistance in this model, but does not occur in all nonresponders.\nQuestion: Is high seizure frequency prior to antiepileptic treatment a predictor of pharmacoresistant epilepsy in a rat model of temporal lobe epilepsy?"}], "answer": "[True]. The data from this study are in line with clinical experience that the frequency of seizures in the early phase of epilepsy is a dominant risk factor that predicts refractoriness. However, resistance to treatment also occurred in rats that did not differ in seizure frequency from responders, indicating that disease severity alone is not sufficient to explain antiepileptic drug (AED) resistance. These data provide further evidence that epilepsy models are useful in the search for predictors and mechanisms of pharmacoresistance."}

The mechanisms by which AKT isoforms mediate signaling to phenotypes associated with PTEN inactivation in cancer have not been defined. Here, we show that AKT2 is exclusively required for PTEN-deficient prostate tumor spheroid maintenance, whereas AKT1 is dispensable. shRNA silencing of AKT2 but not AKT1 promotes regression of prostate cancer xenografts. Mechanistically, we show that AKT2 silencing upregulates p21 and the proapoptotic protein BAX and downregulates the insulin-like growth factor receptor-1. We also show that p21 is an effector of AKT2 in mediating prostate tumor maintenance. Moreover, AKT2 is also exclusively required for the maintenance and survival of other PTEN-deficient solid tumors, including breast cancer and glioblastoma. These findings identify a specific function for AKT2 in mediating survival of PTEN-deficient tumors and provide a rationale for developing therapeutics targeting AKT2.\nQuestion: Do pTEN-deficient tumors depend on AKT2 for maintenance and survival?"}], "answer": "[True]. Depletion of AKT2, but not AKT1, induces potent tumor regression in PTEN-deficient prostate cancer xenografts, concomitant with upregulation of p21, which may serve as a potential biomarker for screening AKT2 activity in clinical samples.

However amphetamine, when given 2-4 h before nicotine, strongly potentiated nicotine-induced locomotor activity. Correspondingly, nicotine given 1-4 h before amphetamine robustly enhanced amphetamine-stimulated locomotor activity even when the effects of the nicotine pretreatment dissipated. Acute nicotine pretreatment similarly potentiated the effects of dopamine transporter ligands, cocaine, nomifensine, and methamphetamine but not a direct dopamine receptor agonist. Consistent with the behavioral studies, in vivo nicotine pretreatment exaggerated amphetamine-induced dopamine efflux from rat striatal slices. Likewise, in vivo pretreatment of rats with amphetamine potentiated nicotine-induced dopamine efflux from striatal slices. Direct pretreatment of striatal tissue by nicotine also potentiated subsequent amphetamine-stimulated dopamine overflow, further suggesting that the nicotine-amphetamine interaction occurs at the level of the dopamine terminal.\nQuestion: Do nicotine and amphetamine acutely cross-potentiate their behavioral and neurochemical responses in female Holtzman rats?"}], "answer": "[True].

The levels of serum proinflammatory and antiinflammatory cytokines were measured using a multiplex bead immunoassay. Cortical and trabecular subchondral bone changes were documented by microfocal computed tomography, and body composition was quantified by dual x-ray absorptiometry.\nRESULTS: Adiposity was increased by approximately 10-fold in ob/ob and db/db mice compared with controls, but it was not associated with an increased incidence of knee OA. Serum cytokine levels were unchanged in ob/ob and db/db mice relative to controls, except for the level of cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant (keratinocyte chemoattractant; murine analog of interleukin-8), which was elevated.

Extreme obesity due to impaired leptin signaling induced alterations in subchondral bone morphology without increasing the incidence of knee OA. Systemic inflammatory cytokine levels remained largely unchanged in ob/ob and db/db mice. These findings suggest that body fat, in and of itself, may not be a risk factor for joint degeneration, because adiposity in the absence of leptin signaling is insufficient to induce systemic inflammation and knee OA in female C57BL/6J mice.

While it is known that Sec61alpha forms the actual channel, the function of the other two subunits remains to be characterized.\nRESULTS: In the present study we have investigated the function of Sec61beta in Drosophila melanogaster. We describe its role in the plasma membrane traffic of Gurken, the ligand for the Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) receptor in the oocyte. Germline clones of the mutant allele of Sec61beta show normal translocation of Gurken into the ER and transport to the Golgi complex, but further traffic to the plasma membrane is impeded. The defect in plasma membrane traffic due to absence of Sec61beta is specific for Gurken and is not due to a general trafficking defect.\nQuestion: Is sec61beta , a subunit of the Sec61 protein translocation channel at the endoplasmic reticulum , involved in the transport of Gurken to the plasma membrane?"}], "answer": "[True].

The effect of cytokine or asthma medication on histamine or bradykinin induced IPx signalling was assessed by [3H] inositol incorporation. Quantitative Real Time PCR was used to measure mRNA levels of receptors and downstream signalling components. Transcriptional mechanisms were explored using a combination of 5'Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (5'RACE) and promoter-reporter techniques.\nRESULTS: Treatment of Human ASM cells with IL-13, IFN gamma or salmeterol for 24 hours lead to a modest augmentation of histamine induced IPx responses (144.3 +/- 9.3, 126.4 +/- 7.5 and 117.7 +/- 5.2%, p < 0.05).

The stimulus to which the synthesis of natriuretic peptides responded in these patients has, however, remained unknown. As the natriuretic peptides have recently been shown to respond to hypoxic conditions, the genes of both A-type and B-type have a hypoxia-response element (HRE) in their promoter sequence, we therefore hypothesized that hypoxia in the human retinal pigment epithelium will increase the secretion of NT-proBNP, the most common natriuretic peptide monitored in clinical medicine.\nMETHODS: We used cultured human retinal pigment epithelium cell line (ARPE-19) which was exposed either to normoxia or to hypoxia for 2 hr, 4 hr, 6 hr and 24 hr. NT-proBNP was measured with enzyme immunoassay, VEGF with ELISA and HIF-1\u03b1 with Western blotting.\nRESULTS: Hypoxia induced VEGF 165 release in culture medium and HIF-1\u03b1 expression in cultured ARPE-19 cells. Time-dependent NT-proBNP release was detected when the ARPE-19 cells were cultured under normoxia. When hypoxia was induced, a statistically significant increase in NT-proBNP release was demonstrated in the culture medium.\nQuestion: Do hypoxic conditions stimulate the release of B-type natriuretic peptide from human retinal pigment epithelium cell culture?"}], "answer": "[True]. Hypoxic conditions increase the release of a natriuretic peptide from retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells. The secretion of VEGF was also enhanced. The responses were associated with the up-regulation of the HIF-1\u03b1 transcription factor. These results explain the previous findings from patients with diabetes, which also suggest that hypoxia is a ubiquitous stimulus for the secretion of natriuretic peptides in human body."}

Six patients achieved complete remission after 3 months of methotrexate therapy and three patients had significant improvement. One patient's condition worsened after achieving a complete response while on methotrexate and the drug was withdrawn completely. No serious adverse events were noted during treatment.\nQuestion: Is low dose methotrexate therapy effective in late-onset atopic dermatitis and idiopathic eczema?"}], "answer": "[True]. Low dose methotrexate is an effective therapeutic alternative for late-onset atopic dermatitis or idiopathic eczema in patients unresponsive to local and other systemic therapies."}

Though less widespread, resistance to both of these alternative insecticide classes has also been documented within the Anopheles gambiae species pair (formerly the M and S molecular forms) in West Africa. To manage insecticide efficacy, it is important to predict how and where resistance is likely to occur and spread, which could be aided by using molecular diagnostics with high predictive value.\nMETHODS: Anopheles coluzzii and An. gambiae s.s. were collected from 18 sites throughout southern Ghana and bioassayed with bendiocarb, the most commonly applied carbamate, and an organophosphate, fenitrothion. The Ace-1 target site substitution G119S was genotyped by qPCR.\nRESULTS: Fenitrothion induced higher mortality than bendiocarb, though phenotypes correlated strongly across populations. Ace-1 119S was found at much higher frequency in An. gambiae s.s than An. coluzzii, exceeding 90% in a population from Greater Accra, the highest frequency reported to date. Ace-1 G119S was very strongly associated with resistance to both insecticides, providing high predictive power for diagnosis, though with some evidence for a differential effect between molecular forms for bendiocarb. Sequencing of the gene revealed a lack of variation in resistant alleles precluding determination of origin, but Ace-1 copy number variation was detected for the first time in Ghana.\nQuestion: Is acetylcholinesterase ( Ace-1 ) target site mutation 119S strongly diagnostic of carbamate and organophosphate resistance in Anopheles gambiae s.s. and Anopheles coluzzii across southern Ghana?"}], "answer": "[True].

Nicotine, which is the major component of tobacco smoke, is thought to be primarily responsible for the addictive properties of tobacco. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying nicotine relapse, hampering development of more effective therapies. The objective of this study was to elucidate the role of medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) glutamatergic and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic receptors in controlling relapse to nicotine seeking.\nMETHODS: Using an intravenous self-administration model, we studied glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor regulation in the synaptic membrane fraction of the rat mPFC following extinction and cue-induced relapse to nicotine seeking. Subsequently, we locally intervened at the level of GABAergic signaling by using a mimetic peptide of the GABA receptor associated protein-interacting domain of GABA type A (GABAA) receptor subunit \u03b32 (TAT-GABA\u03b32) and muscimol, a GABAA receptor agonist.\nRESULTS: Alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors were not regulated after the 30-min relapse test. However, GABAA receptor subunits \u03b11 and \u03b32 were upregulated, and interference with GABAA receptor insertion in the cell membrane using the TAT-GABA\u03b32 peptide in the dorsal mPFC, but not the ventral mPFC, significantly increased responding during relapse. Increasing GABAA transmission with muscimol in the dorsal and ventral mPFC attenuated relapse.\nQuestion: Does prefrontal gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor insertion control cue-induced relapse to nicotine seeking?"}], "answer": "[True]. These data indicate that cue-induced relapse entails a GABAergic plasticity mechanism that limits nicotine seeking by restoring inhibitory control in the dorsal mPFC.

The surfaces were modified by the addition of amines (N,N-dimethylaminoethylmethacrylate; NDAM) or carboxyl moieties (methacrylic acid). The effects of ionic interactions on cellular spreading and on the expression of proteins were examined by modification of the stoichiometrically defined amounts of positive and negative charges on the Hemas.

However, the supply of human hepatocytes is limited due to the shortage of suitable donor organs required to isolate high-quality cells. Human pluripotent stem cells reflect a potential renewable source for generating functional hepatocytes. However, most differentiation protocols use undefined matrices or factors of animal origin; as such, the resulting hepatocytes are not Good Manufacturing Practice compliant. Moreover, the preclinical studies employed to assess safety and function of human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived hepatocytes are generally limited to immunodeficient mice. In the present study, we evaluate the generation of hepatocytes under defined conditions using a European hESC line (VAL9) which was derived under animal-free conditions. The function capacity of VAL9-derived hepatocytes was assessed by transplantation into mice with acetaminophen-induced acute liver failure, a clinically relevant model.\nMETHODS: We developed a protocol that successfully differentiates hESCs into bipotent hepatic progenitors under defined conditions, without the use of chromatin modifiers such as dimethyl sulphoxide. These progenitors can be cryopreserved and are able to generate both committed precursors of cholangiocytes and neonate-like hepatocytes.\nRESULTS: Thirty days post-differentiation, hESCs expressed hepatocyte-specific markers such as asialoglycoprotein receptor and hepatic nuclear factors including HNF4\u03b1. The cells exhibited properties of mature hepatocytes such as urea secretion and UGT1A1 and cytochrome P450 activities. When transplanted into mice with acetaminophen-induced acute liver failure, a model of liver damage, the VAL9-derived hepatocytes efficiently engrafted and proliferated, repopulating up to 10 % of the liver. In these transplanted livers, we observed a significant decrease of liver transaminases and found no evidence of tumourigenicity. Thus, VAL9-derived hepatocytes were able to rescue hepatic function in acetaminophen-treated animals.\nQuestion: Does transplantation of hESC-derived hepatocytes protect mice from liver injury?"}], "answer": "[True]. Our study reveals an efficient protocol for differentiating VAL9 hESCs to neonatal hepatocytes which are then able to repopulate livers in vivo without tumour induction. The human hepatocytes are able to rescue liver function in mice with acetaminophen-induced acute toxicity.

It is linked to many physiological functions in human cells including stress response, protein degradation, organelle turnover, caspase-independent cell death and tumor suppression. Malignant transformation is frequently associated with deregulation of autophagy and several tumor suppressors can modulate autophagic processes. The tumor suppressor p53 can induce autophagy after metabolic or genotoxic stress through transcriptionally-dependent and -independent mechanisms. In this study we expand on the former mechanism by functionally characterizing a p53 family target gene, ISG20L1 under conditions of genotoxic stress.\nRESULTS: We identified a p53 target gene, ISG20L1, and show that transcription of the gene can be regulated by all three p53 family members (p53, p63, and p73). We generated an antibody to ISG20L1 and found that it localizes to the nucleolar and perinucleolar regions of the nucleus and its protein levels increase in a p53- and p73-dependent manner after various forms of genotoxic stress. When ectopically expressed in epithelial cancer-derived cell lines, ISG20L1 expression decreased clonogenic survival without a concomitant elevation in apoptosis and this effect was partially rescued in cells that were ATG5 deficient. Knockdown of ISG20L1 did not alter 5-FU induced apoptosis as assessed by PARP and caspase-3 cleavage, sub-G1 content, and DNA laddering. Thus, we investigated the role of ISG20L1 in autophagy, a process commonly associated with type II cell death, and found that ISG20L1 knockdown decreased levels of autophagic vacuoles and LC3-II after genotoxic stress as assessed by electron microscopy, biochemical, and immunohistochemical measurements of LC3-II.\nQuestion: Is iSG20L1 a p53 family target gene that modulates genotoxic stress-induced autophagy?"}], "answer": "[True].

(ii) SSRI-treated animals developed hind-paw inflammation sooner, and the severity was increased compared to vehicle-treated AA rats.

These data suggest a pro-inflammatory role for central serotonin in this disease model and indicate that treatment with SSRIs may exacerbate the development of inflammation."}

It is based on a model of genome evolution that suggests that the origin of complex phenotypic innovations will be accompanied by the emergence of such founder genes, the descendants of which can still be traced in extant organisms. The origin of multicellularity can be considered to be a macroevolutionary transition, for which new gene functions would have been required. Cancer should be tightly connected to multicellular life since it can be viewed as a malfunction of interaction between cells in a multicellular organism. A phylostratigraphic tracking of the origin of cancer genes should, therefore, also provide insights into the origin of multicellularity.\nRESULTS: We find two strong peaks of the emergence of cancer related protein domains, one at the time of the origin of the first cell and the other around the time of the evolution of the multicellular metazoan organisms. These peaks correlate with two major classes of cancer genes, the 'caretakers', which are involved in general functions that support genome stability and the 'gatekeepers', which are involved in cellular signalling and growth processes. Interestingly, this phylogenetic succession mirrors the ontogenetic succession of tumour progression, where mutations in caretakers are thought to precede mutations in gatekeepers.\nQuestion: Does phylostratigraphic tracking of cancer genes suggest a link to the emergence of multicellularity in metazoa?"}], "answer": "[True]. A link between multicellularity and formation of cancer has often been predicted. However, this has not so far been explicitly tested. Although we find that a significant number of protein domains involved in cancer predate the origin of multicellularity, the second peak of cancer protein domain emergence is, indeed, connected to a phylogenetic level where multicellular animals have emerged. The fact that we can find a strong and consistent signal for this second peak in the phylostratigraphic map implies that a complex multi-level selection process has driven the transition to multicellularity."}

Accurate characterization of the association between coronary disease and AAA and of the actual prevalence of AAA among patients with angiography-verified coronary artery disease (CAD) is needed to evaluate the possible benefits of systematic screening for AAA.\nMETHODS: We searched for studies that reported the association between AAA and CAD or coronary heart disease (CHD; wider phenotype definition) in the general population (randomized controlled trials, prospective population cohorts) and those that reported the prevalence of AAA among patients with angiography-verified CAD through PubMed, Embase, and reference lists for the period between 1980 and 2014. Random-effects models were applied because of the high heterogeneity between included studies.\nRESULTS: Among the general population, 23 studies reported the association between CHD and the occurrence of subclinical AAA (positive ultrasound screening; meta-analyzed odds ratio of 2.38 with 95% confidence interval [CI] of 1.78-3.19; P = 4.1 \u00d7 10(-9)). According to four prospective studies, CHD is a strong predictor of future AAA events (fatal and nonfatal; meta-analyzed hazard ratio of 3.49 with 95% CI of 2.56-4.76; P = 2.4 \u00d7 10(-15)). Altogether, 10 studies reported the prevalence of AAA among patients with angiography-verified CAD or undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting. Among men, meta-analyzed prevalence was 9.5% (95% CI, 7.6%-11.7%). Among men undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting or with three-vessel disease, the prevalence was 11.4% (95% CI, 9.1%-13.9%). Among women, the prevalence was low (0.35%).\nQuestion: Is the prevalence of abdominal aortic aneurysm consistently high among patients with coronary artery disease?"}], "answer": "[True]. The risk of subclinical AAA and future AAA events is high among patients with coronary disease. Screening for AAA among CAD patients by cardiologists would be easy and inexpensive, with possible benefits to survival and risk evaluation."}

We evaluate the effect of PSM parameters on BCR rates from robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy, across 3 high-volume institutions.\nMETHODS: De-identifiable clinicopathological and histopathological data were prospectively collected for 4,001 patients with at least 3 years of follow-up. Kaplan-Meier plots and 3 statistical models were used to evaluate the effect of margin parameters on BCR, via crude rates, traditional multivariable Cox regression, and a propensity-adjusted Cox regression model.\nRESULTS: Overall, 37% of men with a PSM developed BCR compared with 10% of men with negative margins (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.81, 95% CI: 1.47-2.22). Length \u22653 mm or a multifocal positive margin was associated with a higher risk of BCR compared with negative margin cases. On multivariable Cox regression analysis of the positive margin cohort, only apical margins significantly predicted BCR relative to basal margins (HR = 2.03, 95% CI: 1.01-4.09), whereas there was no significant difference in BCR rates for posterolateral margins relative to basal margins (HR = 1.62, 95% CI: 0.84-3.11).

Its activity is modulated by cellular oxidants. Hepatitis C core protein and ethanol exposure both cause enhanced oxidant generation. The aim was to investigate whether core protein, by its ability to generate oxidants, alters proteasome activity and whether these alterations are further affected by ethanol exposure.\nMETHODS: These interactions were examined in Huh-7 cell lines that expressed inducible HCV core protein and/or constitutive cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) and as purified components in a cell-free system. Chymotrypsin-like proteasome activity was measured fluorometrically.\nRESULTS: Proteasome activity in core-positive 191-20 cells was 20% higher than that in core-negative cells and was enhanced 3-fold in CYP2E1-expressing L14 cells. Exposure of core-positive cells to glutathione ethyl ester, catalase, or the CYP2E1 inhibitor diallyl sulfide partially reversed the elevation of proteasome activity in core-positive cells, whereas ethanol exposure suppressed proteasome activity. The results indicate that proteasome activity was up-regulated by low levels of core-induced oxidative stress but down-regulated by high levels of ethanol-elicited stress. These findings were partially mimicked in a cell-free system. Addition of core protein enhanced the peptidase activity of purified 20S proteasome containing the proteasome activator PA28 and was further potentiated by addition of liver mitochondrial and/or microsome fractions. However, proteasome activation was significantly attenuated when fractions were obtained from ethanol-fed animals.\nQuestion: Is proteasome activation by hepatitis C core protein reversed by ethanol-induced oxidative stress?"}], "answer": "[True].

The vasomotor changes, initiated by the mechanical stretch of the stenotic region, are thought to be due to various mechanisms but whether the sympathetic nervous system plays a role in this phenomenon remains unknown.\nRESULTS: Quantitative angiography (ARTREK) was performed in 45 patients undergoing an epicardial vessel PTCA for a stenosis of 76 +/- 1% (1) in basal conditions, (2) after PTCA, and (3) 30 minutes after PTCA (vasoconstriction). In 14 control patients, the same measurements were obtained up to 60 minutes after PTCA. Coronary diameters were measured along the PTCA vessel at the narrowest stenosis level and at a level peripheral to stenosis. In 36 patients two diameters were also measured at a proximal segment and at a distal segment along a nonmanipulated vessel. Thirty minutes after PTCA the dilated segment underwent a -31 +/- 2% (mean +/- SEM, ANOVA, P < .05) reduction in diameter when compared with PTCA values, and the segment peripheral to stenosis showed a reduction of -17 +/- 2% (P < .05). In all patients a significant vasoconstriction also was observed along the control vessel (proximal segment, -14 +/- 3%; P < .05 versus basal; and distal segment, -17 +/- 2%). At the time of maximal vasoconstriction (30 minutes after PTCA), the patients (treatment groups) received (1) 18 micrograms/kg IC phentolamine (Phe, n = 7), (2) 14 micrograms/kg IC yohimbine (YO, n = 7), (3) 16 micrograms/kg IC propranolol (Pro) followed by 18 micrograms/kg IC phentolamine (Pro+Phe, n = 7), and (4) 0.2 mg/kg IC bretylium (Bre, n = 10). In 14 patients (control groups) an intracoronary injection of warm saline was given. After drug injections, angiograms were repeated at 5-minute intervals for 20 minutes and ended after a 300-micrograms intracoronary trinitroglycerin injection. At stenosis level, Phe and Bre counteracted vasoconstriction, inducing a dilatation of +19 +/- 3% and +22 +/- 6%, respectively, while Pro+Phe caused a dilatation of +16 +/- 9% above the PTCA values (P < .05 versus PTCA). YO only partially reversed vasoconstriction (from -33 +/- 4% to -12 +/- 4%, P = NS versus PTCA). At peripheral-to-stenosis level, vasoconstriction was abolished by Phe (+26 +/- 7%, P < .05 versus basal), while it was still present after Pro+Phe (-23 +/- 2%) and Bre (-18 +/- 4%). In addition, Phe and Bre dilated the control vessel at the proximal segment (+17 +/- 6% and +8 +/- 4%, respectively, P < .05 versus basal), while YO and Pro+Phe only counteracted vasoconstriction (from -15 +/- 3% to +7.6 +/- 1% and from -16 +/- 3% to +4 +/- 5%, respectively, P = NS versus basal). At the distal segment only Phe produced a vasodilatation of +23 +/- 1%; YO counteracted constriction (from -16 +/- 2% to +9 +/- 6%, P < .05 versus basal), whereas after Pro+Phe and Bre, the vasoconstriction persisted.\nQuestion: Is coronary vasoconstriction after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty attenuated by antiadrenergic agents?"}], "answer": "[True]. The mechanical stretch and ischemia caused by balloon inflation induced vasoconstriction mediated by alpha-adrenergic receptors (mainly alpha 1), overcoming a beta-mediated dilatation. The use of different antiadrenergic drugs showed that Phe counteracts post-PTCA vasoconstriction, and the simultaneous use of alpha- and beta-receptor blocking agents (Pro+Phe and Bre) reveals the presence of a peripheral, predominant beta-mediated dilatation.

Synapses are formed from the interaction of neurites projecting from \"presynaptic\" neurons with dendritic spines projecting from \"postsynaptic\" neurons. Both of these structures are vulnerable to the toxic effects of nearby amyloid plaques, and their loss contributes to the decreased number of synapses that characterize the disease. A treatment that increased the formation of neurites and dendritic spines might reverse this loss, thereby increasing the number of synapses and slowing the decline in cognition.\nUNASSIGNED: We observe that giving normal rodents uridine and the omega-3 fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) orally can enhance dendritic spine levels (3), and cognitive functions (32). Moreover this treatment also increases levels of biochemical markers for neurites (i.e., neurofilament-M and neurofilament-70) (2) in vivo, and uridine alone increases both these markers and the outgrowth of visible neurites by cultured PC-12 cells (9). A phase 2 clinical trial, performed in Europe, is described briefly.\nQuestion: Is synapse formation enhanced by oral administration of uridine and DHA , the circulating precursors of brain phosphatides?"}], "answer": "[True]. Uridine and DHA are circulating precursors for the phosphatides in synaptic membranes, and act in part by increasing the substrate-saturation of enzymes that synthesize phosphatidylcholine from CTP (formed from the uridine, via UTP) and from diacylglycerol species that contain DHA: the enzymes have poor affinities for these substrates, and thus are unsaturated with them, and only partially active, under basal conditions. The enhancement by uridine of neurite outgrowth is also mediated in part by UTP serving as a ligand for neuronal P2Y receptors. Moreover administration of uridine with DHA activates many brain genes, among them the gene for the m-1 metabotropic glutamate receptor [Cansev, et al, submitted]. This activation, in turn, increases brain levels of that gene's protein product and of such other synaptic proteins as PSD-95, synapsin-1, syntaxin-3 and F-actin, but not levels of non-synaptic brain proteins like beta-tubulin. Hence it is possible that giving uridine plus DHA triggers a neuronal program that, by accelerating phosphatide and synaptic protein synthesis, controls synaptogenesis. If administering this mix of phosphatide precursors also increases synaptic elements in brains of patients with Alzheimer 's disease, as it does in normal rodents, then this treatment may ameliorate some of the manifestations of the disease."}

The majority of the affected genes are involved in chemotaxis, cell adhesion, cell infiltration or cytoskeleton organisation, suggesting lower immune cell adhesion to endothelial cells. This was corroborated by in vitro experiments showing that MOF exposure of monocytes attenuates their adhesion to TNF-\u03b1-stimulated endothelial cells. Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) reporter gene assays confirmed that MOF decrease the activity of NF-\u03baB. Strong inter-individual variability in the leukocytes' DNA methylation was observed.

In order to assess the availability of resveratrol as an angio-inhibiting drug, we examined whether resveratrol plays an important role in bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs) for cell apoptosis and cell migration.\nMETHODS: Endothelial cell apoptosis was observed as detected by the Hoechst staining and the caspase-3 activity. Additionally, Western blotting was performed for monitoring the activities of various cell signaling molecules.\nRESULTS: Resveratrol was shown to act as a pro-apoptotic agent. The pro-apoptotic effect of resveratrol was as great as that of etoposide, a well-known anti-cancer drug. In addition, resveratrol had an inhibitory effect on endothelial cell migration. The demonstrated efficacy of resveratrol suggests that resveratrol may be utilized as an anti-angiogenic drug. To determine the underlying mechanisms, we further investigated which signaling molecules are activated by resveratrol. Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) was activated by the treatment with resveratrol in BAECs, whereas endothelial nitric oxide synthetase (eNOS), Akt, and Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) were inhibited. The pretreatment with PD compound, an ERK inhibitor, had no effect on the pro-apoptosis induced by resveratrol.\nQuestion: Does resveratrol at high doses act as an apoptotic inducer in endothelial cells?"}], "answer": "[True].

Previously we found that estrogen aided in this neovasculogenesis via recruitment of bone marrow derived endothelial progenitor cells (BM-EPCs), leading to increased vessel formation and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production in vivo. However, the cellular mechanism of this induction and the signaling pathways involved need elucidation.\nRESULTS: Using the murine mammary cell line TG1-1 we observed estrogen (E2) lead to an up regulation of hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), an effect abrogated by the anti-estrogen Fulvestrant and the HIF-1 inhibitor YC-1 (3-(5'-hydroxymethyl-2'-furyl)-1-benzylindazole) suggesting the interchangeability of hypoxia and estrogen mediated effects. Estrogen modulation of HIF-1 and subsequent effects on endothelial cells is dependent on the Akt/PI3K pathway and protein synthesis as validated by the use of the inhibitors wortmannin and cycloheximide which abrogated estrogen's effects respectively. Estrogen treated TG1-1 cells secreted higher levels of VEGF which were comparable to secreted levels from cells grown under hypoxic conditions.

Cultured human keratinocytes were treated with parental drugs or with their UVB photoproducts, and survival following UVA irradiation was measured by thiazolyl blue metabolism. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and 8-oxoguanine were monitored by fluorescence microscopy.\nRESULTS: Voriconazole and voriconazole N-oxide have varying UVB absorption but do not acutely sensitize cultured human keratinocytes following UVB exposure. However, sustained UVB exposures produced notable dose- and solvent-dependent changes in the absorption spectra of voriconazole N-oxide, which in aqueous solution acquires a prominent UVA absorption band, suggesting formation of a discrete photoproduct.

School closure was assumed to take place only once during the course of the pandemic, abruptly reducing child-to-child transmission for a fixed length of time and also influencing the transmission between children and adults. Public health effectiveness was measured by reduction in the cumulative incidence, and cost effectiveness was also examined by calculating the incremental cost effectiveness ratio and adopting a threshold of 1.0 \u00d7 10\u2077 Japanese Yen/life-year.\nRESULTS: School closure at the epidemic peak appeared to yield the largest reduction in the final size, while the time of epidemic peak was shown to depend on the transmissibility.

Nevertheless, the cost effectiveness analysis showed that the cost of our school closure scenario with the parameters derived from H1N1-2009 was not justifiable.

The aim of the study was to investigate the concentrations of matrix metalloproteinase-9 in plasma and peritoneal fluid of patients with endometriosis.\nMETHODS: A prospective case-control study was conducted in Jinan Military General Hospital between January 2010 and December 2013. Fifty patients with proven endometriosis and 26 endometriosis-free controls were enrolled in this study. Patients with endometriosis were evaluated and divided into moderate/severe endometriosis group (stage I-II, n\u2009=\u200926) and minimal/mild endometriosis group (stage III-IV, n\u2009=\u200924) according to the revised criteria of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine. Blood samples and peritoneal fluid were obtained from both patients and controls. Matrix metalloproteinase-9 was measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in plasma and peritoneal fluid. The concentration of matrix metalloproteinase-9 between different groups was compared and its correlation to disease severity was analysed.\nRESULTS: Plasma and peritoneal fluid concentrations of matrix metalloproteinase-9 in patients with endometriosis were higher than that in controls. In addition, those patients with moderate/severe endometriosis had significantly higher plasma and peritoneal fluid concentrations of matrix metalloproteinase-9 compared to those with minimal/mild endometriosis. Matrix metalloproteinase-9 concentrations in plasma and peritoneal fluid were both positively correlated with severity of endometriosis and plasma matrix metalloproteinase-9 concentrations had a positive correlation with peritoneal fluid matrix metalloproteinase-9 concentrations in patients with endometriosis.\nQuestion: Are the plasma and peritoneal fluid concentrations of matrix metalloproteinase-9 elevated in patients with endometriosis?"}], "answer": "[True]. Increased concentrations of plasma and peritoneal fluid concentrations of matrix metalloproteinase-9 appear to be associated with disease severity of endometriosis and may serve as an alternative biomarker to determine disease severity of endometriosis."}

Patients with stroke attributable to cardiac embolism or other specific etiologies and patients with amaurosis fugax were excluded. Ischemic strokes in the remaining 534 patients were classified as nonlacunar (n=236) or lacunar (n=298) based on clinical symptoms and multidetector CT of the brain.

In contrast, adhesion and spreading of platelets on recombinant podoplanin, CLEC-2 antibody and LECs is not affected by PGI2 and GSNO. Consistent with this, CLEC-2 activation of Rac, which is required for platelet spreading, is not altered in the presence of PGI2 .\nQuestion: Is cLEC-2-dependent activation of mouse platelets weakly inhibited by cAMP but not by cGMP?"}], "answer": "[True]. The present results demonstrate that platelet adhesion and activation on CLEC-2 ligands or LECs is maintained in the presence of PGI2 and NO."}

A total of 101 consecutive surgically resected peripheral adenocarcinomas of the lung measuring 3.0cm or less in the maximum dimension on HRCT were examined both radiologically and histologically. All CT scans ware reviewed by three chest radiologists or pulmonologists. The following parameters were measured on HRCT: the greatest diameter of tumor on found on all CT cuts (Td), the greatest diameter of consolidation found on all CT cuts (Cdmax), and the greatest diameter of consolidation found on a particular CT cut (Cd). Consolidation to tumor size ratio at respective maximum dimensions was calculated as Cdmax/Td, and consolidation to tumor size ratio on the slice image with the maximum tumor dimension was calculated as Cd/Td. One pathologist reviewed all pathological specimens to determine the size of tumor, evidence of vessel invasion, etc. without any information of HRCT, and we compared CT findings with pathological findings.\nRESULTS: There was a statistically significant difference between tumors with pathologic T1N0M0 adenocarcinoma without vessel invasion (least invasive disease: LID) and tumors with lymph node involvement or vessel invasion (invasive disease: ID) in each parameter.

MMP expression was also confirmed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting. We then investigated the association between MMP expression detected by gelatin zymography and the intensity of gelatinolytic activity determined by FIZ.\nRESULTS: FIZ demonstrated that all tumor tissues had in situ gelatinolytic activities. There was a statistically significant correlation between the intensity of gelatinolytic activity, and tumor grade, stage, vessel invasion and cause specific survival (p <0.05).

Despite similar infarct size (area of infarction relative to area at risk) 24 hours after ligation of the coronary artery in Tg-CTGF and NLC mice, Tg-CTGF mice disclosed smaller area of scar tissue, smaller increase of cardiac hypertrophy, and less LV dilatation and deterioration of LV function 4 weeks after MI. Tg-CTGF mice also revealed substantially reduced mortality after MI. Remote/peri-infarct tissue of Tg-CTGF mice contained reduced numbers of leucocytes, macrophages, and cells undergoing apoptosis as compared with NLC mice. In a cohort of patients with acute ST-elevation MI (n\u200a=\u200a42) admitted to hospital for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) serum-CTGF levels (s-CTGF) were monitored and related to infarct size and LV function assessed by cardiac MRI.

Because the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway is involved in liver homeostasis and regeneration and in liver carcinogenesis, we investigated here a role for Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in the embryonic liver. A cyclization recombination (Cre)/locus of X-over P1 (loxP) strategy was chosen to perform adenomatous polyposis coli (Apc) invalidation in order to activate ectopic beta-catenin signaling in hepatoblasts; an appropriate transgenic model expressing the Cre recombinase was used. Phenotypic and immunolocalization studies, together with messenger RNA analyses, by microarray and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction approaches were performed on this model during normal hepatogenesis. The loss of Apc allowed beta-catenin activation in the hepatoblasts after the formation of the liver bud and led to embryonic lethality. In this model, the liver became hypoplastic, and hepatocyte differentiation failed, whereas beta-catenin-activated ducts developed and gave rise to fully differentiated bile ducts when transplanted into adult recipient livers. Microarray analyses suggested that beta-catenin plays a role in repressing the hepatocyte genetic program and remodeling the ductal plate. According to these data, in normal embryonic livers, beta-catenin was transiently activated in the nascent bile ducts.\nQuestion: Does stabilization of beta-catenin affect mouse embryonic liver growth and hepatoblast fate?"}], "answer": "[True].

The present study aimed to reveal the mechanisms of IR cleavage.\nMETHODS: Using the in vitro model, we investigated the molecular mechanisms of IR cleavage, which is accelerated by high-glucose treatment. We also analysed the relationship between IR cleavage and cellular insulin resistance, and the correlation between plasma sIR levels and insulin sensitivity, which was assessed by the euglycaemic-hyperinsulinaemic clamp technique.\nRESULTS: Here, we determined that calpain 2, which is secreted into the extracellular space associated with exosomes, directly cleaved the ectodomain of the IR\u03b2 subunit (IR\u03b2), which in turn promoted intramembrane cleavage of IR\u03b2 by \u03b3-secretase. IR cleavage impaired insulin signalling and the inhibition of IR cleavage (by knockdown of calpain 2 and \u03b3-secretase), restored IR substrate-1 and Akt, independent of IR. Furthermore, the glucose-lowering drug, metformin, prevented IR cleavage accompanied by inhibition of calpain 2 release in exosomes, and re-established insulin signalling.

However, it is not clear how this protein propagates from its source, the blastoderm margin, to the target cells in the prospective neural plate, and how lipid-modifications might influence Wnt8a propagation and activity.\nRESULTS: We have dynamically imaged biologically active, fluorescently tagged Wnt8a in living zebrafish embryos. We find that Wnt8a localizes to membrane-associated, punctate structures in live tissue. In Wnt8a expressing cells, these puncta are found on filopodial cellular processes, from where the protein can be released. In addition, Wnt8a is found colocalized with Frizzled receptor-containing clusters on signal receiving cells. Combining in vitro and in vivo assays, we compare the roles of conserved Wnt8a residues in cell and non-cell-autonomous signaling activity and secretion.

In multivariable analysis, involvement of any surgical trainee was associated with procedures that took a greater length of time, had a greater odds of blood transfusion, and necessitated a longer hospital LOS relative to procedures performed by an attending surgeon alone. Only bypasses wherein PGY5+s were involved were associated with greater odds of early graft failure, unplanned readmission, and 30-day mortality when compared with procedures done without trainee involvement. After excluding lower extremity bypasses in which an attending surgeon operated without a trainee, propensity score matching analysis showed that patients operated on by PGY5+s had longer operative time (4.11 vs. 3.96\u00a0hr, P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) and greater rates of postoperative bleeding (9.77% vs. 8.15%, P\u00a0=\u00a00.004) relative to patients operated on by attendings assisted by PGY1-4s, but no statistically significant difference in LOS, early graft failure, unplanned readmission, and perioperative mortality.\nQuestion: Is operative Autonomy among Senior Surgical Trainees during Infrainguinal Bypass Operations Associated with Worse Long-term Patient Outcomes?"}], "answer": "[False]. Operative involvement of senior trainees was associated with worse outcomes during infrainguinal bypass, potentially reflecting a lesser extent of attending surgeon involvement, but no difference in patient outcomes after bypass procedure."}

Regression analyses were used to identify relationships between variables.\nRESULTS: After training, 86% of subjects increased VO2max and lost weight. Glycosylated hemoglobin, fasting glucose, and 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test were reduced in 69%, 62%, and 68% of subjects, respectively, while insulin sensitivity improved in 90% of the participants. Changes in glycemic control were congruent with changes in GSIS such that 66% of subjects had a reduction in first-phase GSIS, and 46% had reduced second-phase GSIS. Training increased first- and second-phase DI in 83% and 74% of subjects. Training-induced changes in glycemic control were related to changes in GSIS (P < .05), but not insulin sensitivity or DI, and training-induced improvements in glycemic control were largest in subjects with greater pretraining GSIS.\nQuestion: Is pancreatic \u03b2-cell function a stronger predictor of changes in glycemic control after an aerobic exercise intervention than insulin sensitivity?"}], "answer": "[True].

Besides improving insulin sensitivity, the anti-diabetic drug metformin can reduce lipid accumulation in skeletal muscle; however, its mechanism of action remains unclear.\nMETHODS: Ob/ob mice and C2C12 cells were used to explore the effects of metformin on the morphological and physiological changes of lipid droplets. To clarify the mechanism by which metformin regulates fatty acid metabolism, a cDNA microarray and quantitative real-time PCR were used to examine the effects of metformin on the transcriptome of C2C12 cells treated with 200 micromol/L oleic acid.\nRESULTS: Metformin could retard body weight gain, improve insulin sensitivity and reduce intramyocellular lipid accumulation in ob/ob mice. In C2C12 cells, metformin inhibited lipid accumulation, stimulated fatty acid oxidation, and decreased triglyceride synthesis. Twenty-seven differentially expressed genes, including 12 upregulated and 15 downregulated genes, were involved in fatty acid metabolism. Interestingly, several genes involved in acyl-CoA synthesis and fatty acid oxidation were also upregulated, such as Ppard, Acsbg1, Ascl3, and Mlycd. However, several genes related to lipolysis were downregulated, such as Ces1d and Cel.

The biological mechanisms through which folate prevents birth defects are not well understood. We explore the use of zebrafish as a model system to investigate the role of folate metabolism during development.\nRESULTS: We first identified zebrafish orthologs of 12 human folate metabolic genes. RT-PCR and in situ analysis indicated maternal transcripts supply the embryo with mRNA so that the embryo has an intact folate pathway. To perturb folate metabolism we exposed zebrafish embryos to methotrexate (MTX), a potent inhibitor of dihydrofolate reductase (Dhfr) an essential enzyme in the folate metabolic pathway. Embryos exposed to high doses of MTX exhibited developmental arrest prior to early segmentation. Lower doses of MTX resulted in embryos with a shortened anterior-posterior axis and cardiac defects: linear heart tubes or incomplete cardiac looping. Inhibition of dhfr mRNA with antisense morpholino oligonucleotides resulted in embryonic lethality. One function of the folate pathway is to provide essential one-carbon units for dTMP synthesis, a rate-limiting step of DNA synthesis. After 24 hours of exposure to high levels of MTX, mutant embryos continue to incorporate the thymidine analog BrdU. However, additional experiments indicate that these embryos have fewer mitotic cells, as assayed with phospho-histone H3 antibodies, and that treated embryos have perturbed cell cycles.\nQuestion: Does disruption of the folate pathway in zebrafish cause developmental defects?"}], "answer": "[True].

The aims of our study were to establish the prevalence of subjects with L-FMC, to determine whether the magnitude of L-FMC correlates with magnitude of FMD, and to determine whether L-FMC can be used to predict FMD timing.\nMETHODS: A total of 179 outpatients were studied, and the brachial artery diameter was measured every minute during the 5 min forearm ischemia.

The secretion of inhibin A and B is regulated differentially during the early stages of lactational amenorrhoea, just as it is in the late luteal phase of the normal menstrual cycle. Whilst inhibin A falls postpartum, reflecting cessation of placental function, and remains low until ovulatory cycles are resumed, FSH and inhibin B rise after a delay of two weeks or more.

We investigated in the 5/6 nephrectomy model (1) the renal distribution of COX-2; (2) the hemodynamic and cellular mechanisms by which chronic COX-2 inhibition prevents renal injury.\nMETHODS: After 5/6 nephrectomy, adult male Munich-Wistar rats were subdivided in two groups: 5/6 nephrectomy (N=20), receiving vehicle, and 5/6 nephrectomy + celecoxib (N=19), treated orally with the COX-2 inhibitor, celecoxib, 10 mg/kg/day. Untreated and treated (celecoxib) sham-operated rats were also studied. Renal hemodynamics were examined at 4 weeks, whereas renal morphologic/immunohistochemical studies were carried at 8 weeks.\nRESULTS: At 4 weeks, 5/6 nephrectomy rats exhibited marked systemic and glomerular hypertension. Celecoxib attenuated both systemic and glomerular hypertension, without affecting glomerular filtration rate (GFR). At 8 weeks, glomerulosclerosis and interstitial expansion were evident in 5/6 nephrectomy rats, and markedly attenuated in 5/6 nephrectomy rats given celecoxib. In both sham-operated and 5/6 nephrectomy rats, COX-2 was expressed at the macula densa. The extent of COX-2 expression at the macula densa was nearly tripled by celecoxib, indicating the existence of a feedback mechanism. In 5/6 nephrectomy rats, COX-2 was also expressed in glomeruli, arterioles, and the cortical interstitium, mostly at inflamed or sclerosing areas. Celecoxib markedly attenuated renal injury, inflammation, and ectopic COX-2 expression in 5/6 nephrectomy rats.\nQuestion: Does cyclooxygenase-2 ( COX-2 ) inhibition limit abnormal COX-2 expression and progressive injury in the remnant kidney?"}], "answer": "[True]. Chronic COX-2 inhibition attenuated progressive nephropathy by reducing glomerular hypertension, renal inflammation, and ectopic COX-2 expression, indicating a complex contribution of COX-2 to progressive renal injury in 5/6 nephrectomy rats."}

The primary outcome was unplanned readmission, and secondary outcomes were discharge to a nonhome facility, LOS, and reasons for unplanned readmission. Univariate, multivariate, and stratified analyses based on gender and discharge destination were used.\nRESULTS: Overall, 1541 patients (8.7%) experienced an unplanned readmission, with a significantly higher risk in women vs men (10.8% vs 8%; P\u00a0< .001) overall (Procedure subtypes: abdominal aortic aneurysm [10.1% vs 7.7%; P\u00a0< .001], thoracic aortic aneurysm [14.1% vs 13.5%; P\u00a0= .8], and thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm [14.8% vs 10%; P\u00a0= .051]).

While the neurological-related pathogenesis is well studied, the cardiac pathogenesis remains unknown. The current study exposed isolated ventricular cardiomyocytes and adult rat hearts to T. brucei to test whether trypanosomes can alter cardiac function independent of a systemic inflammatory/immune response.\nRESULTS: Using confocal imaging, T. brucei and T. brucei culture media (supernatant) caused an increased frequency of arrhythmogenic spontaneous diastolic sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR)-mediated Ca(2+) release (Ca(2+) waves) in isolated adult rat ventricular cardiomyocytes. Studies utilising inhibitors, recombinant protein and RNAi all demonstrated that this altered SR function was due to T. brucei cathepsin-L (TbCatL). Separate experiments revealed that TbCatL induced a 10-15% increase of SERCA activity but reduced SR Ca(2+) content, suggesting a concomitant increased SR-mediated Ca(2+) leak. This conclusion was supported by data demonstrating that TbCatL increased Ca(2+) wave frequency. These effects were abolished by autocamtide-2-related inhibitory peptide, highlighting a role for CaMKII in the TbCatL action on SR function.

However, the influence of moderate and common forms of stress on early human brain development is less well-understood and precisely characterized. To date, most work has focused on severe forms of stress, and/or on brain functioning years after stress exposure.\nMETHODS: In this report we focused on conflict between parents (interparental conflict), a common and relatively moderate form of ELS that is highly relevant for children's mental health outcomes. We used resting state functional connectivity MRI to examine the coordinated functioning of the infant brain (N = 23; 6-12-months-of-age) in the context of interparental conflict. We focused on the default mode network (DMN) due to its well-characterized developmental trajectory and implications for mental health. We further examined DMN strength as a mediator between conflict and infants' negative emotionality.\nRESULTS: Higher interparental conflict since birth was associated with infants showing stronger connectivity between two core DMN regions, the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and the anterior medial prefrontal cortex (aMPFC). PCC to amygdala connectivity was also increased. Stronger PCC-aMPFC connectivity mediated between higher conflict and higher negative infant emotionality.\nQuestion: Is early life stress associated with default system integrity and emotionality during infancy?"}], "answer": "[True]. The developing DMN may be an important marker for effects of ELS with relevance for emotional development and subsequent mental health. Increasing understanding of the associations between common forms of family stress and emerging functional brain networks has potential to inform intervention efforts to improve mental health outcomes."}

Recently, based on the use of mutants blocked in autophagy, it has been demonstrated that autophagy is required for strict maternal inheritance in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Uniparental mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) inheritance has been well documented for numerous fungal species, and in particular, has been shown to be genetically governed by the mating-type loci in the isogamous species Cryptococcus neoformans, Phycomyces blakesleeanus and Ustilago maydis. Previously, we have shown that the a2 mating-type locus gene lga2 is decisive for UPI during sexual development of U. maydis. In axenic culture, conditional overexpression of lga2 triggers efficient loss of mtDNA as well as mitophagy. To assess a functional relationship, we have investigated UPI in U. maydis \u0394atg11 mutants, which are blocked in mitophagy.\nRESULTS: This study has revealed that \u0394atg11 mutants are not affected in pathogenic development and this has allowed us to analyse UPI under comparable developmental conditions between mating-compatible wild-type and mutant strain combinations. Explicitly, we have examined two independent strain combinations that gave rise to different efficiencies of UPI. We demonstrate that in both cases UPI is atg11-independent, providing evidence that mitophagy is not critical for UPI in U. maydis, even under conditions of strict UPI.\nQuestion: Is uniparental mitochondrial DNA inheritance affected in Ustilago maydis \u0394atg11 mutants blocked in mitophagy?"}], "answer": "[False]. Until now, analysis of a role of mitophagy in UPI has not been reported for microbial species.

MA-PD plans have been increasing their adherence intervention efforts as an approach to improving beneficiaries' medication adherence and the plan's quality performance ratings. However, few evaluations have examined the effects of these interventions on medication adherence and performance ratings.\nOBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of a quasi-experimental multichannel adherence intervention on beneficiaries' medication adherence and health plan quality performance measures for 2 MA-PD plans. The intervention included a daily prescriber-directed 90-day retail refill component and a weekly member-directed refill reminder component.\nMETHODS: Members filling 1 or more medications assessed by the 3 CMS star ratings adherence measures (oral antidiabetics [DM], antihypertensives [HTN], and statins [CHOL]) were identified for a 2-component intervention starting in April 2013. The retail-based 90-day refill component sent populated 90-day prescription letters via fax to prescribers of members who had filled a 30-day prescription. One fax per member-medication instance was sent and included the option to fax approval of a new 90-day prescription. For prescribers who approved, members were notified that a 90-day refill was available at their retail pharmacies. The refill reminder component used weekly scans of pharmacy claims to identify members' refill patterns. Reminder letters were sent to members 7 days late to refill. An intent-to-treat approach was used to assess intervention effectiveness. Pharmacy claims and health plan enrollment data were used to calculate adherence among members enrolled 1 year pre- and postintervention start (April 2013) for the intervention group and a comparator group that consisted of 4 MA-PD plans not implementing an adherence intervention. Adherence was estimated by the proportion of days covered (PDC) and generalized linear models were fit to calculate difference-in-difference (DID) estimators to control for demographics, comorbidity, and changes in adherence over the study period. To estimate the impact of the intervention on health plan quality performance, 2013 and 2014 CMS star ratings for the respective 2012 and 2013 measurement years were compared by group.\nRESULTS: During the first year of the intervention, 1,344 prescribers representing 6,701 members were faxed 15,284 populated prescription letters. Prescriber response rate was 53.7% and approval rate (approved letters of total sent) was 47.3%. An average of 539 refill reminder letters were sent per week.

ABG was evident over high and low frequencies and was significantly larger at low frequencies and in ears with structural anomalies. A high rate of CSF leak was observed in patients with an ABG and structural anomalies imaging as well as in those with an ABG and normal imaging findings.\nQuestion: Do air-bone gap component of inner-ear origin in audiograms of cochlear implant candidates?"}], "answer": "[True]. In cochlear implant candidates, the presence of a third window could cause an ABG because of stapes motion-induced shunting of acoustic energy outside the cochlear duct in response to air-conducted stimuli while bone conduction is preserved."}

In both assays, fragments containing the second and third type 1 repeats but not the procollagen region inhibited angiogenesis and endothelial cell proliferation. To further define the sequences responsible for the angiostatic effect of TSP-1, we used synthetic peptides. The CAM assay defined 2 sequences that independently suppressed angiogenesis. The amino-terminal end of the type 1 repeats showed higher potency for inhibiting angiogenesis driven by basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2), whereas the second region equally blocked angiogenesis driven by either FGF-2 or vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Modifications of the active peptides revealed the specific amino acids required for the inhibitory response. One sequence included the conserved tryptophan residues in the amino-terminal end of the second and third type 1 repeats, and the other involved the amino acids that follow the CSVTCG sequence in the carboxy-terminus of these repeats.

Buffer-perfused rabbit lungs were exposed to 270 minutes of warm ischemia while anoxic ventilation and a positive intravascular pressure were maintained.\nRESULTS: On reperfusion, a massive increase of the capillary filtration coefficient and severe edema formation were noted, whereas microvascular pressures displayed only minor changes. Short-time aerosolization of subthreshold doses of either rolipram (33 microg) or PGI(2) (2.6 microg) at the beginning of ischemia did not attenuate the leakage response, whereas the co-aerosolization of both agents largely blocked any permeability increase and edema formation, independent of hemodynamic effects. The same was true when the co-aerosolization was undertaken before onset of ischemia. Similarly, the intravascular administration of rolipram and PGI(2) showed a synergistic reduction of I/R-induced vascular leak but demanded 10-fold higher doses.

All hypodermal cell walls are thin, except for thick lowermost periclinal walls associated with the upper periclinal walls of the subtending palisade cells. These thick walls display 'quilted' impressions (mounds) formed by many subtending palisade cells. Conspicuous depressions occur in most mounds, and each depression contains what appear to be many plasmodesmata. These depressions are opposite similar regions in adjacent thin palisade periclinal walls, and they can be considered special pit fields that represent thin translucent regions ('windows' or 'skylights'). Druses in the vacuoles of palisade cells occur below these pit field regions and are surrounded by conspicuous cytoplasmic chloroplasts with massive grana oriented perpendicular to the crystals, probably providing for an efficient photosynthetic system under low-intensity light.\nMETHODS: Leaf clearings and fractures, light microscopy and crossed polarizers, general and histochemical staining, and transmission and scanning electron microscopy were used to examine these structures.\nRESULTS: Druses in the vacuoles of palisade cells occur below the thin pit field regions in the wall interface, suggesting an interesting physical relationship that could provide a pathway for light waves, filtered through the multiple hypodermis.

In contrast to previous studies that attributed a minor regulatory role to EtrA in Shewanella spp., this study demonstrates that EtrA acts as a global transcriptional regulator and, in conjunction with other regulators, fine-tunes the expression of genes involved in anaerobic metabolism in S. oneidensis strain MR-1. Transcriptomic and sequence analyses of the genes differentially expressed showed that those mostly affected by the mutation belonged to the \"Energy metabolism\" category, while stress-related genes were indirectly regulated in the mutant possibly as a result of a secondary perturbation (e.g. oxidative stress, starvation).

Mechanistic information on this process is currently sparse.\nRESULTS: Here we explore the mechanistic basis by which GATA3 functions as a pioneer TF in a cellular reprogramming event relevant to breast cancer, the mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET). In some instances, GATA3 binds previously inaccessible chromatin, characterized by stable, positioned nucleosomes where it induces nucleosome eviction, alters local histone modifications, and remodels local chromatin architecture. At other loci, GATA3 binding induces nucleosome sliding without concomitant generation of accessible chromatin. Deletion of the transactivation domain retains the chromatin binding ability of GATA3 but cripples chromatin reprogramming ability, resulting in failure to induce MET.\nQuestion: Does gATA3-dependent cellular reprogramming require activation-domain dependent recruitment of a chromatin remodeler?"}], "answer": "[True]. These data provide mechanistic insights into GATA3-mediated chromatin reprogramming during MET, and suggest unexpected complexity to TF pioneering. Successful reprogramming requires stable binding to a nucleosomal site; activation domain-dependent recruitment of co-factors including BRG1, the ATPase subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex; and appropriate genomic context.

If well-studied Mediterranean and eastern European refugia are widely accepted, some recent biogeographical assumptions still remain unclear, such as the occurrence of multiple glacial refugia in Iberia and cryptic refugia in northern Europe during the last glaciations. The Lusitanian snail Elona quimperiana has a remarkably disjunct distribution, limited to northwestern France (Brittany), northwestern Spain and the Basque Country. By describing the phylogeographical structure of this species across its entire range, the present study attempts to identify refugia and subsequent recolonization routes.\nRESULTS: Results based on 16S and COI gene sequences showed that the low genetic diversity observed in the Brittany populations should be associated with a recent demographic expansion. By contrast, populations from Spain exhibit several differentiated lineages and are characterized by demographic equilibrium, while the Basque populations are the only ones harboring typical distinct haplotypes. The center of the star-like networks of both gene sequences is occupied by a common ancestral-like haplotype found in Brittany and Spain, which might have originated from the middle of Northern Spain (i.e. Asturias, eastern Lugo and western Cantabria). Estimates of the divergence time between the Spain-Brittany and Basque lineages strongly suggest that E. quimperiana survived the Pleistocene glaciations in distinct refugia on the Iberian Peninsula, one of which is situated in Picos de Europa, and the other in the Basque Country.

Present results confirm the Iberian origin of the land snail E. quimperiana and strongly support the emerging phylogeographic hypothesis of multiple refugia in Iberia during the last glaciations. The scenario of a spatial expansion of E. quimperiana from an Iberian refuge located in Asturias to northern areas provides the most probable explanation for the present distribution of this land snail. By harboring distinct haplotypes, the Basque Country populations appear to be of great importance in terms of potential adaptation, long term persistence and hence, the conservation of E. quimperiana."}

In this paper, we present the results obtained in L.infantum and a mechanistic basis is proposed.\nRESULTS: Exposure of the parasites to allicin led to high Ca2+ levels and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS), collapse of the mitochondrial membrane potential, reduced production of ATP and elevation of cytosolic ROS. The incubation of the promastigotes with SYTOX Green revealed that decrease of ATP was not associated with plasma membrane permeabilization. Annexin V and propidium iodide (PI) staining indicated that allicin did not induce phospholipids exposure on the plasma membrane. Moreover, DNA agarose gel electrophoresis and TUNEL analysis demonstrated that allicin did not provoke DNA fragmentation. Analysis of the cell cycle with PI staining showed that allicin induced cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase.\nQuestion: Does allicin induce Calcium and Mitochondrial Dysregulation Causing Necrotic Death in Leishmania?"}], "answer": "[True]. We conclude that allicin induces dysregulation of calcium homeostasis and oxidative stress, uncontrolled by the antioxidant defense of the cell, which leads to mitochondrial dysfunction and a bioenergetic catastrophe leading to cell necrosis and cell cycle arrest in the premitotic phase."}

Maternal plasma samples were collected before labor (groups A and B), then immediately after delivery, and again at 20 to 24 hours post partum (groups A and C). Amniotic fluid was also collected in early labor, and umbilical cord blood was collected at delivery (groups A and C). Samples were assayed for fetal fibronectin by a specific enzyme-linked immunoassay.\nRESULTS: Before labor maternal plasma levels of fetal fibronectin were significantly elevated in preeclamptic patients compared with patients in group B (p < 0.0001). Plasma levels of fetal fibronectin were also increased in preeclamptic patients compared with patients in group C at delivery (p < 0.0001) and post partum (p < 0.05). Additionally, amniotic fluid levels of fetal fibronectin in the preeclamptic patients were significantly increased (p < 0.05).

Fetal fibronectin is elevated in the maternal plasma and amniotic fluid, but not umbilical cord plasma, of patients with severe preeclampsia.

We evaluated the mechanisms of cardiac glycosides, including digoxin, digitoxin and ouabain (Sigma\u00ae), on prostate specific antigen gene expression in vitro.\nMETHODS: We cultured LNCaP cells (ATCC\u00ae) and used them to determine the effect of cardiac glycosides on prostate derived Ets factor and prostate specific antigen expression. We determined prostate derived Ets factor and prostate specific antigen expression by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, immunoblot, transient gene expression assay or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.\nRESULTS: Noncytotoxic doses (100 nM) of cardiac glycosides for 24 hours inhibited prostate specific antigen secretion by LNCaP cells. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and immunoblot revealed that cardiac glycosides significantly down-regulated prostate specific antigen and prostate derived Ets factor expression. Transient gene expression assays showed that prostate derived Ets factor over expression enhanced prostate specific antigen promoter activity. However, prostate specific antigen and prostate derived Ets factor gene promoter activity was attenuated when LNCaP cells were treated with 100 nM cardiac glycosides. When LNCaP cells were treated with 25 nM digitoxin or digoxin for 60 hours, prostate specific antigen secretion decreased by 30%.\nQuestion: Do cardiac glycosides decrease prostate specific antigen expression by down-regulation of prostate derived Ets factor?"}], "answer": "[True]. Results suggest that cardiac glycoside inhibition of prostate specific antigen gene expression may be caused by the down-regulation of prostate derived Ets factor gene expression. When cells were chronically treated with digoxin or digitoxin at concentrations close to or at therapeutic plasma levels, prostate specific antigen secretion decreased. This phenomenon merits further study to determine whether it occurs in men on cardiac glycoside therapy."}

C2C12 myoblasts grow more slowly without glucose irrespective of the presence of galactose, which is not consumed by the cells, and they fail to differentiate without glucose in the medium. Cells grown in a no-glucose medium (with or without galactose) have lower maximal respiration and spare respiratory capacity than cells grown in the presence of glucose. However, increasing glucose concentration above physiological levels decreases the achievable maximal respiration. C2C12 myotubes differentiated at a high glucose concentration showed higher dependency on oxidative respiration under basal conditions but had lower maximal and spare respiratory capacity when compared to cells differentiated under low glucose condition.

Data were analyzed for concurrent visual assessments and SEM, which were obtained at the right and left buttocks and sacrum weekly for 20 weeks. Subepidermal moisture was measured with a surface electrical capacitance dermal phase meter, where higher readings indicate greater SEM (range: 0-999 dermal phase units [DPUs]). Visual assessment was rated as normal, erythema/stage I PU, or stage II+ PU. Subepidermal moisture and specific SEM threshold values (50, 150, 300 DPU) were modeled as detectors of visual assessment of early PU 1 week later (controlling for clustering and incontinence); with concurrent SEM, and PU risk status, in separate analyses for persons with light and dark skin tones.\nRESULTS: Participants had a mean age of 84 years, 83% were female, and 77% were non-Hispanic white. Higher SEM predicted greater likelihood of erythema/stage I PU and stage II+ PU in persons with dark skin tones the next week (OR = 1.88 for every 100 DPU increase in SEM, P = .004). When SEM was greater than 50, 150, and 300 DPU, persons with dark skin tones were 8.5, 13, and 10 times more likely to present with stage II+ PU the following week compared to persons with light skin who were 7.2, 3.5, and 4.3 times more likely to present with stage II PU (50, 150, 300 DPU, respectively). Subepidermal moisture threshold of 50 DPU was also significant for detecting erythema/stage I PU in persons with dark skin tones (OR = 5.3, 95% CI, 1.87-15.11, P < .001).\nQuestion: Is subepidermal moisture associated with early pressure ulcer damage in nursing home residents with dark skin tones : pilot findings?"}], "answer": "[True]. Subepidermal moisture was associated with future (1 week later) PU in persons with dark skin tones.

A promising example is the specific elimination of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infected cells by LTR-driven suicide genes. The success of this approach, however, depends on a fast and effective suicide gene, which is expressed exclusively in HIV-1 infected cells. These preconditions have not yet been completely fulfilled and, thus, success of suicide approaches has been limited so far. We tested truncated Bid (tBid), a human pro-apoptotic protein that induces apoptosis very rapidly and efficiently, as suicide gene for gene therapy against HIV-1 infection.\nRESULTS: When tBid was introduced into the HIV-1 LTR-based, Tat- and Rev-dependent transgene expression vector pLRed(INS)2R, very efficient induction of apoptosis was observed within 24 hours, but only in the presence of both HIV-1 regulatory proteins Tat and Rev. Induction of apoptosis was not observed in their absence. Cells containing this vector rapidly died when transfected with plasmids containing full-length viral genomic DNA, completely eliminating the chance for HIV-1 replication. Viral replication was also strongly reduced when cells were infected with HIV-1 particles.\nQuestion: Does a suicide gene approach using the human pro-apoptotic protein tBid inhibit HIV-1 replication?"}], "answer": "[True].

Activation of Pyk2 was Src-dependent, but did not require phospholipase C\u03b32 activity. Platelets from Pyk2 knockout mice showed a defective ability to adhere and spread on fibrinogen, in association with a dramatic reduction of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) activation and Akt phosphorylation. Pharmacological and genetic analysis demonstrated that integrin \u03b1IIb\u03b23 engagement selectively stimulated the \u03b2-isoform of PI3K (PI3K\u03b2), and that, as for Pyk2, PI3K\u03b2 activation required Src family kinases activity, but not phospholipase C\u03b32.

Exogenous treatment of human OSCCA cell lines with rhBMP-2 prior to engraftment in an orthotopic animal model caused the subsequent tumors to be more locally aggressive with worse survival. Continued caution should be used for considering rhBMP-2 for reconstruction of bone defects in oral cancer patients."}

Whole genome scans for linkage to AS phenotypes have been conducted, although results have been inconsistent between studies and all have had modest sample sizes. One potential solution to these issues is to combine data from multiple studies in a retrospective meta-analysis.\nMETHODS: The International Genetics of Ankylosing Spondylitis Consortium combined data from three whole genome linkage scans for AS (n = 3744 subjects) to determine chromosomal markers that show evidence of linkage with disease. Linkage markers typed in different centres were integrated into a consensus map to facilitate effective data pooling. We performed a weighted meta-analysis to combine the linkage results, and compared them with the three individual scans and a combined pooled scan.\nRESULTS: In addition to the expected region surrounding the HLA-B27 gene on chromosome 6, we determined that several marker regions showed significant evidence of linkage with disease status. Regions on chromosome 10q and 16q achieved 'suggestive' evidence of linkage, and regions on chromosomes 1q, 3q, 5q, 6q, 9q, 17q and 19q showed at least nominal linkage in two or more scans and in the weighted meta-analysis. Regions previously associated with AS on chromosome 2q (the IL-1 gene cluster) and 22q (CYP2D6) exhibited nominal linkage in the meta-analysis, providing further statistical support for their involvement in susceptibility to AS.\nQuestion: Does combined analysis of three whole genome linkage scan for Ankylosing Spondylitis?"}], "answer": "[True]. These findings provide a useful guide for future studies aiming to identify the genes involved in this highly heritable condition."}

Using a multiple linear regression analysis, LDL-cholesterol, and triglycerides levels were identified as independently associated with TSH. Multivariate logistic regression analysis determined that TSH levels strongly contributed to MetS. Compared with the lower most quartile (TSH, 0.3-1.44 mIU/L), the adjusted odds ratio for MetS was 1.95 in the upper most quartile (TSH, 2.48-4.00 mIU/L).

Although TKIs have demonstrated good clinical efficacy, the lack of complete responses, the chronic nature of the treatment, and the side effects are clear disadvantages. An interesting new approach in the treatment of clear cell RCC is antibody-mediated therapy with the chimeric anti-carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX) antibody girentuximab (cG250). As the results of several girentuximab trials become available, the question arises of whether TKI treatment can be combined with girentuximab-based therapy. In this study, we assessed the effect of the widely used TKI sorafenib on the tumor-targeting potential of (111)In-labeled girentuximab.\nMETHODS: (111)In-girentuximab imaging was performed on 15 patients suspected of having a renal malignancy, with surgery being part of their treatment plan. Of these, 10 patients were treated in a neoadjuvant setting with sorafenib (400 mg orally twice daily). Five patients received treatment during 1 wk, and 5 patients received treatment during 4 wk. In both sorafenib-treated groups, baseline and posttreatment tumor targeting of (111)In-girentuximab were compared. Surgery was performed 3 d after the last image acquisition. Five additional patients were included as a control group and had only a single (111)In-girentuximab injection and scintigraphy without any treatment. Distribution of (111)In-girentuximab was determined scintigraphically ex vivo in a 1-cm lamella of the resected tumorous kidney. Expression of CAIX and of the vascular marker CD31 was determined immunohistochemically on specimens of both tumor and normal kidney tissue.\nRESULTS: Treatment with sorafenib resulted in a marked decrease of (111)In-girentuximab uptake in the tumor in clear cell RCC patients, especially in the group treated for 4 wk (mean change in both sorafenib-treated groups, -38.4%; range, +9.1% to -79.4%). Immunohistochemical analysis showed markedly reduced CD31 expression and vessel density in the sorafenib-treated groups but no differences in CAIX expression between the sorafenib-treated groups and the nontreated patients.\nQuestion: Does tyrosine kinase inhibitor sorafenib decrease 111In-girentuximab uptake in patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma?"}], "answer": "[True]. Treatment with sorafenib resulted in a treatment duration-dependent significantly decreased uptake of (111)In-girentumab in clear cell RCC lesions.

Seven piglets under normoxic and normocalcemic conditions were the controls. The other piglets underwent hypoxemia and subsequent reoxygenation, for periods of 30 minutes each, under normo-calcemic (Normo-Ca++, n= 7) or hypocalcemic conditions (Hypo-Ca++, n=7). Thirty minutes after discontinuation of CPB, the hemodynamic function was assessed taking into account stroke work indices (SWI), end systolic elastance (EES), pulmonary vascular resistance index (PVRI), cardiac release of conjugated dienes (CD) and creatine phosphokinase (CK), and myocardial oxygen consumption (MVO2). These parameters were expressed as a percentage of the pre-CPB value. The endogenous antioxidant reserve capacity (AORC) of ventricular wall specimens was determined by in-vitro lipid peroxidation forming malondealdehyde (nmol MDA/g protein).\nRESULTS: After one hour of CPB the cardiac performance returned to normal range without any functional or metabolic disturbance. The normocalcemic condition resulted in a hardly impaired cardiac performance (42%**SWI; 67%**EES), an augmented PVRI (more than 4-fold**), and highly elevated release of CD and CK (3-fold** each).

Here, we demonstrate that overexpression of miR-155 drives an increased mutation frequency both in vitro and in vivo, promoting genomic instability by affecting multiple DNA repair pathways. miR-155 overexpression causes a decrease in homologous recombination, but yields a concurrent increase in the error-prone nonhomologous end-joining pathway. Despite repressing established targets MLH1 and MSH6, the identified mutation pattern upon miR-155 overexpression does not resemble that of a mismatch repair-deficient background.

FOXO3a, a transcription factor and known target of miR-155, has one or more putative binding site(s) in the promoter of all four polymerase delta subunits.

Assessment of tumor cell proliferation cannot classify accurately high risk patients at a clinically applicable level. However, identification of patients at low risk for metastasis by flow cytometry, immunohistochemical proliferation markers and volume of embryonal carcinoma may be possible at the 90% level.

A systematic approach for the assessment of FH was applied to this subgroup of the registry. A positive FH for premature CVD, defined as a first-degree relative having a CVD event before the age of 55 years in men and 65 years in women, conferred reclassification to high risk.

They are possesing a key role to favor viral replication via their interaction with multiple cellular proteins. In a yeast two-hybrid screen we have identified Sprouty1 (Spry1) as a target of adenoviral E1A Oncoproteins. Spry proteins are central and complex regulators of the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signalling pathway. The deregulation of Spry family members is often associated with alterations of the RTK signalling and its downstream effectors, leading to the ERK pathway.\nRESULTS: Here, we confirm our yeast two-hybrid data, showing the interaction between Spry1 and E1A in GST pull-down and immunoprecipitation assays. We also demonstrated the interaction of E1A with two further Spry isoforms. Using deletion mutants we identified the N-terminus and the CR conserved region (CR) 3 of E1A- and the C-terminal half of Spry1, which contains the highly conserved Spry domain, as the essential sites for direct interaction between Spry and E1A. Immunofluorescent microscopy data revealed a co-localization of E1A(13S) with Spry1 in the cytoplasm. SRE and TRE reporter assays demonstrated that co-expression of Spry1 with E1A(13S) abolishes the inhibitory function of Spry1 in RTK signalling, which is consequently accompanied with a decrease of E1A13S-induced gene expression.\nQuestion: Is sprouty a cytoplasmic target of adenoviral E1A oncoproteins to regulate the receptor tyrosine kinase signalling pathway?"}], "answer": "[True].

The aims of this study were to characterize the temporal response of CD34+ progenitors following vascular injury in an ovine model and to evaluate an affinity pheresis approach to attenuate this response.\nMETHODS: An ovine model underwent either operative vascular injury or a nonvascular surgery (n = 3 per group). Blood was examined perioperatively over 2 weeks by flow cytometry. Next, an affinity pheresis approach to mediate systemic depletion of CD34 progenitors was designed. Custom agarose pheresis matrix with antibody affinity toward CD34 or an isotype control was evaluated in vitro. Next, following vascular injury, sheep underwent perioperative whole blood volume pheresis toward either the progenitor cell marker CD34 (n = 3) or an isotype control (n = 4) for 14 days. Animals were monitored by physical exam as well as complete blood counts. Cells recovered by pheresis were eluted and examined by flow cytometry.\nRESULTS: Flow cytometry revealed a focal surge of circulating CD34 cells after vascular injury but not among surgical controls (P = .05). Toward the goal of an approach to attenuate the surge of CD34 progenitors, an evaluation of high-flow affinity matrix revealed efficacy in removal of progenitors from ovine blood in vitro. Next, a separate group of animals undergoing affinity pheresis after vascular injury was evaluated to mediate systemic depletion of CD34+ cells. Again, a surge of CD34+ cells was observed among isotype pheresis animals following vascular intervention but was attenuated over 20-fold by a CD34 pheresis approach (P = .029). Furthermore, an average of 77 million CD34-positive cells were eluted from the CD34 pheresis matrix. Despite multiple sessions of pheresis, complete blood counts remained essentially unchanged over 2 weeks.\nQuestion: Does cD34 affinity pheresis attenuate a surge among circulating progenitor cells following vascular injury?"}], "answer": "[True]. Despite evidence suggesting a role for CD34+ circulating progenitor cells in restenotic pathology, the temporal pattern of CD34 progenitors after vascular injury has not been previously defined. We have demonstrated a surge among circulating CD34+ cells that appears confined to procedures involving vascular injury and that this event seems to occur early after vascular injury. We further conclude that CD34 affinity pheresis attenuates the surge. This approach for direct depletion of progenitors may have important implications for the study of progenitors in vascular restenosis."}

The aim of present study is to understand the mechanistic aspects of thalidomide-mediated attenuation of angiogenesis induced by nitric oxide at the cellular level.\nMETHODS: To study the cellular mechanism of thalidomide-mediated blocking of angiogenesis triggered by nitric oxide, we used two endothelial cell based models: 1) wound healing and 2) tube formation using ECV 304, an endothelial cell line. These cell-based models reflect pro-angiogenic events in vivo. We also studied the effects of thalidomide on nitric oxide mediated egg yolk angiogenesis. Thalidomide could block the formation of blood vessels both in absence and presence of nitric oxide. Thalidomide effects on migration of, and actin polymerization in, ECV 304 cells were studied at the single cell level using live cell imaging techniques and probes to detect nitric oxide.\nRESULTS: Results demonstrate that thalidomide blocks nitric oxide-mediated angiogenesis in egg yolk model and also reduces the number of tubes formed in endothelial cell monolayers. We also observed that thalidomide arrests wound healing in presence and absence of nitric oxide in a dose-dependent fashion. Additionally, thalidomide promotes actin polymerization and antagonizes the formation of membrane extensions triggered by nitric oxide in endothelial cells. Experiments targeting single tube structure with thalidomide, followed by nitric oxide treatment, show that the tube structures are insensitive to thalidomide and nitric oxide. These observations suggest that thalidomide interferes with nitric oxide-induced migration of endothelial cells at the initial phase of angiogenesis before cells co-ordinate themselves to form organized tubes in endothelial cells and thereby inhibits angiogenesis.\nQuestion: Does thalidomide attenuate nitric oxide mediated angiogenesis by blocking migration of endothelial cells?"}], "answer": "[True].

The purpose of the survey was to gather more detailed information about informed consent procedures used in the trial, over and above basic information provided in the trial report. We describe our approach-which allowed extensive personalization without the need for specialized computer technology-and discuss its potential application in similar settings.\nRESULTS: The mail merge feature of standard word processing software was used to generate unique, personalized questionnaires for each author by incorporating specific information from the article, including naming the randomization unit (e.g., family practice, school, worksite), and identifying specific individuals who may have been considered research participants at the cluster level (family doctors, teachers, employers) and individual level (patients, students, employees) in questions regarding informed consent procedures in the trial. The response rate was relatively high (64%, 182/285) and did not vary significantly by author, publication, or study characteristics. The refusal rate was low (7%).\nQuestion: Do mail merge can be used to create personalized questionnaires in complex surveys?"}], "answer": "[True]. While controlled studies are required to examine the specific effects of our approach on comprehension, quality of responses, and response rates, we showed how mail merge can be used as a simple but useful tool to add personalized fields to complex survey questionnaires, or to request additional information required from study authors.

In contrast, mesangial cells use both receptors for their attachment to collagen but utilize only VLA-1 in their interaction with laminin. The use of VLA-1 by GEC and of VLA-2 by mesangial cells was unexpected because the expression of these receptors was barely detectable in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and by immunocytochemistry.\nQuestion: Do glomerular epithelial and mesangial cells differentially modulate the binding specificities of VLA-1 and VLA-2?"}], "answer": "[True]. VLA-1, VLA-2, and VLA-3 are integrin receptors with overlapping specificities in that all have the potential to interact with collagen and laminin. Our studies demonstrate that cultured GEC use VLA-1 and VLA-2 almost exclusively for their adhesion to these ligands, and thus VLA-3 appears to play a negligible role in such attachment. Interestingly, GEC and mesangial cells differentially modulate the ligand binding specificities of VLA-1 and VLA-2. In situ, VLA-1 has been localized within the mesangium, whereas VLA-2 has not been detected within the glomerulus leading to the conclusion that GEC do not use VLA-1 or VLA-2 and that mesangial cells fail to utilize VLA-2. However, our studies have shown that, even when such receptors are barely detectable on the surface of cultured cells by sensitive techniques, they can play a functional role. These results suggest either that the levels of expression in situ are too low for the relatively insensitive immunohistochemical techniques employed, and thus the importance of these receptors to glomerular cell attachment in vivo is under appreciated or that such receptors are the result of de novo expression by glomerular cells when they are subjected to in vitro culture conditions. Because it is known that such conditions may mimic pathologic stress, we are presently examining the expression of these receptors by glomerular cells in various disease models."}

Elevated plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) is a major risk for cardiovascular disease. A common 677C-->T mutation in the MTHFR gene results in decreased enzymic activity, and contributes to increased plasma tHcy, in association with low plasma folate. A recently described 1298A-->C mutation in the MTHFR gene clearly reduces MTHFR activity (although to a lesser extent than the 677C-->T) but its effect on plasma tHcy levels is not yet clear.\nOBJECTIVE: To investigate the frequency of these two MTHFR polymorphisms in a Portuguese population, and to correlate the MTHFR genotype with the biochemical phenotype at the level of homocysteine and folate concentrations.\nMETHODS: Prospective population survey.\nMETHODS: We studied 117 healthy volunteers (71 females, 46 males). The 677C-->T and 1298A-->C mutations were screened by PCR-RFLP. Levels of plasma tHcy and folate, and red blood cell folate, were determined.\nRESULTS: The allele frequencies of the 677C-->T and 1298A-->C mutations were 0.33 and 0.28, respectively. Homozygotes for the 677C-->T mutation had significantly elevated plasma tHcy and RBC folate levels and significantly lowered plasma folate concentrations than subjects without the mutation. The 1298A-->C mutation showed a significant effect on plasma tHcy, but not on plasma folate or RBC folate levels.\nQuestion: Are 5,10-Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase 677C -- > T and 1298A -- > C mutations genetic determinants of elevated homocysteine?"}], "answer": "[True]. The observed 677T allele frequency is not consistent with the idea of a north-south gradient as previously suggested. The 1298A-->C mutation is common in Portugal.

But it is uncertain whether, in practice, this influences the effects of ACEi on mortality and major morbidity after MI.\nMETHODS: This overview sought individual patient data from all trials involving more than 1,000 patients randomly allocated to receive ACEi or control starting in the acute phase of MI (0-36 h from onset) and continuing for four to six weeks. Data on concomitant ASA use were available for 96,712 of 98,496 patients in four eligible trials (and for none of 1,556 patients in the one other eligible trial).\nRESULTS: Overall 30-day mortality was 7.1% among patients allocated to ACEi and 7.6% among those allocated to control, corresponding to a 7% (standard deviation [SD], 2%) proportional reduction (95% confidence interval 2% to 11%, p = 0.004).

Studies have suggested that creation of a multidisciplinary team including orthopaedic surgeons, internal medicine physicians, social workers, and specialized physical therapists, to comanage these patients can decrease complication rates, improve time to surgery, and reduce hospital length of stay; however, they have yet to achieve widespread implementation, partly owing to concerns regarding resource requirements necessary for a comanagement program.\nOBJECTIVE: We performed an economic analysis to determine whether implementation of a comanagement model of care for geriatric patients with osteoporotic hip fractures would be a cost-effective intervention at hospitals with moderate volume. We also calculated what annual volume of cases would be needed for a comanagement program to \"break even\", and finally we evaluated whether universal or risk-stratified comanagement was more cost effective.\nMETHODS: Decision analysis techniques were used to model the effect of implementing a systems-based strategy to improve inpatient perioperative care. Costs were obtained from best-available literature and included salary to support personnel and resources to expedite time to the operating room. The major economic benefit was decreased initial hospital length of stay, which was determined via literature review and meta-analysis, and a health benefit was improvement in perioperative mortality owing to expedited preoperative evaluation based on previously conducted meta-analyses. A break-even analysis was conducted to determine the annual case volume necessary for comanagement to be either (1) cost effective (improve health-related quality of life enough to be worth additional expenses) or (2) result in cost savings (actually result in decreased total expenses). This calculation assumed the scenario in which a hospital could hire only one hospitalist (and therapist and social worker) on a full-time basis. Additionally, we evaluated the scenario where the necessary staff was already employed at the hospital and could be dedicated to a comanagement service on a part-time basis, and explored the effect of triaging only patients considered high risk to a comanagement service versus comanaging all geriatric patients. Finally, probabilistic sensitivity analysis was conducted on all critical variables, with broad ranges used for values around which there was higher uncertainty.\nRESULTS: For the base case, universal comanagement was more cost effective than traditional care and risk-stratified comanagement (incremental cost effectiveness ratios of USD 41,100 per quality-adjusted life-year and USD 81,900 per quality-adjusted life-year, respectively). Comanagement was more cost effective than traditional management as long as the case volume was more than 54 patients annually (range, 41-68 patients based on sensitivity analysis) and resulted in cost savings when there were more than 318 patients annually (range, 238-397 patients). In a scenario where staff could be partially dedicated to a comanagement service, universal comanagement was more cost effective than risk-stratified comanagement (incremental cost effectiveness of USD 2300 per quality-adjusted life-year), and both comanagement programs had lower costs and better outcomes compared with traditional management.

There also was no difference in the ambulatory BP or HR response after the single session of resistive exercise based on the training status of the subjects.\nQuestion: Does acute resistive exercise affect ambulatory blood pressure in young men and women?"}], "answer": "[False]. Thus, the elevated BP that occurs during resistive exercise does not persist in the 24 h after acute resistive exercise in sedentary, resistance-trained, or endurance-trained, young, normotensive men and women."}

In the presence of nonhydrolyzable nucleotide analog, ATP gamma S or ADP beta S, application of flow resulted in similar shear-dependent [Ca2+]i oscillations, suggesting that flow modulation of the [Ca2+]i response was not simply due to depletion of ATP or ADP in the vicinity of BAEC monolayers as a result of hydrolysis of nucleotides by ectonucleotidases.\nQuestion: Does fluid flow modulate vascular endothelial cytosolic calcium responses to adenine nucleotides?"}], "answer": "[True].

To elucidate genetic polymorphisms associated with a susceptibility to radiation-induced dermatitis, a large-scale single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis using DNA samples from 156 patients with breast cancer was conducted.\nMETHODS: Patients were selected from more than 3,000 female patients with early breast cancer who received radiotherapy after undergoing breast-conserving surgery.

For the SNP analysis, DNA samples from each patient were subjected to the genotyping of 3,144 SNPs covering 494 genes.\nRESULTS: SNPs that mapped to two genes, ABCA1 and IL12RB2, were associated with radiation-induced dermatitis. In the ABCA1 gene, one of these SNPs was a nonsynonymous coding SNP causing R219K (P = 0.0065). As for the IL12RB2 gene, the strongest association was observed at SNP-K (rs3790568; P = 0.0013).

SWI/SNF complexes are recruited to chromatin through multiple mechanisms, including specific DNA-binding factors (for example, heat shock transcription factor 4 (Hsf4) and paired box gene 6 (Pax6)), chromatin structural proteins (for example, high-mobility group A1 (HMGA1)) and/or acetylated core histones. Previous studies have shown that a single amino acid substitution (K798R) in the Brg1 ATPase domain acts via a dominant-negative (dn) mechanism. Genetic studies have demonstrated that Brg1 is an essential gene for early (that is, prior implantation) mouse embryonic development. Brg1 also controls neural stem cell maintenance, terminal differentiation of multiple cell lineages and organs including the T-cells, glial cells and limbs.\nRESULTS: To examine the roles of Brg1 in mouse lens development, a dnBrg1 transgenic construct was expressed using the lens-specific \u03b1A-crystallin promoter in postmitotic lens fiber cells. Morphological studies revealed abnormal lens fiber cell differentiation in transgenic lenses resulting in cataract. Electron microscopic studies showed abnormal lens suture formation and incomplete karyolysis (that is, denucleation) of lens fiber cells. To identify genes regulated by Brg1, RNA expression profiling was performed in embryonic day 15.5 (E15.5) wild-type and dnBrg1 transgenic lenses. In addition, comparisons between differentially expressed genes in dnBrg1 transgenic, Pax6 heterozygous and Hsf4 homozygous lenses identified multiple genes coregulated by Brg1, Hsf4 and Pax6. DNase II\u03b2, a key enzyme required for lens fiber cell denucleation, was found to be downregulated in each of the Pax6, Brg1 and Hsf4 model systems. Lens-specific deletion of Brg1 using conditional gene targeting demonstrated that Brg1 was required for lens fiber cell differentiation, for expression of DNase II\u03b2, for lens fiber cell denucleation and indirectly for retinal development.\nQuestion: Is chromatin remodeling enzyme Brg1 required for mouse lens fiber cell terminal differentiation and its denucleation?"}], "answer": "[True]. These studies demonstrate a cell-autonomous role for Brg1 in lens fiber cell terminal differentiation and identified DNase II\u03b2 as a potential direct target of SWI/SNF complexes.

Inhibition of Epac-Rap1 signaling has been proposed as a therapeutic strategy for both cancer and cardiovascular disease. However, previous work suggests that impaired Rap1 signaling may have detrimental effects on cardiac function. The aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of Epac2-Rap1 signaling on the heart using both in vivo and in vitro approaches.\nRESULTS: Impaired Epac2 signaling induced early afterdepolarization arrhythmias in ventricular myocytes. The underlying mechanism involved an increase in mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) and activation of the late sodium current (INa<sub>late</sub>). Arrhythmias were blocked by inhibition of INa<sub>late</sub> or the mitochondria-targeted antioxidant mitoTEMPO. In vivo, inhibition of Epac2 caused ventricular tachycardia, torsades de pointes and sudden death. The in vitro and in vivo effects of Epac2 inhibition were mimicked by inhibition of geranylgeranyltransferase-1, which blocks interaction of Rap1 with downstream targets.\nMETHODS: Our findings show for the first time that Rap1 acts as a negative regulator of mitochondrial ROS production in the heart and that impaired Epac2-Rap1 signaling causes arrhythmias due to ROS dependent activation of INa<sub>late</sub>.

These differentiated pericytes, in turn, are recruited to bind with capillary-like networks formed by endothelial cells on the matrigel under in vitro conditions and recruited to bind with blood vessels on gel-foam under in vivo conditions. The degree of recruitment of pericytes into in vitro neo-angiogenesis is tumor cell phenotype specific. Interestingly, invasive cells recruit less pericytes as compared to non-invasive cells. We identified tumor cell-secreted platelet-derived growth factor-B (PDGF-B) as a crucial factor controlling the differentiation and recruitment processes through an interaction with neuropilin-1 (NRP-1) in mesenchymal stem cells.\nQuestion: Does tumor cell-derived PDGF-B potentiate mouse mesenchymal stem cells-pericytes transition and recruitment through an interaction with NRP-1?"}], "answer": "[True]. These new insights into the roles of tumor cell-secreted PDGF-B-NRP-1 signaling in MSCs-fate determination may help to develop new antiangiogenic strategies to prevent the tumor growth and metastasis and result in more effective cancer therapies."}

Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) is involved in the stability of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and atherosclerosis plaque. Until now, it is established that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and norepinephrine (NE) are associated with the pathological process of atherosclerosis. However, the combined effect of LPS and NE on MMP-9 is unclear. We investigated the combined effect of LPS and NE on MMP-9 expression in human monocytes and the mechanism involved in the process.\nMETHODS: THP-1 cells were cultured and treated with LPS and/or NE. MMP-9 and TIMP-1 gene and protein expression were detected by real time PCR and ELISA, respectively. MMP-9 activity was detected by gelatin zymography. Adrenoceptor antagonists and MAPKs inhibitors were used to clarify the mechanism. Pathway-related proteins were detected by Western blot.\nRESULTS: We found that NE enhances LPS-induced MMP-9 and TIMP-1 expression as well as MMP-9 activity in THP-1 cells. This effect is reversed by the beta (\u03b2)-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol, extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) inhibitor U0126, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) inhibitor SP600125. NE enhances LPS-induced ERK/JNK phosphorylation. NE up-regulates LPS-induced c-Fos expression, which is counteracted by propranolol, U0126, and SP600125. Furthermore, c-Fos silence reverses the effect of NE on MMP-9 activity.\nQuestion: Does beta-adrenoceptor Activation by Norepinephrine enhance Lipopolysaccharide-induced Matrix Metalloproteinase-9 Expression Through the ERK/JNK-c-Fos Pathway in Human THP-1 Cells?"}], "answer": "[True].

In addition to r-TEG values, gender and injury severity score (ISS) were chosen a priori for developing a multiple logistic regression model predicting development of PE.\nRESULTS: r-TEG was obtained on 2,070 consecutive trauma activations. Of these, 2.5% (53) developed PE, 97.5% (2,017) did not develop PE. Patients in the PE group were older (median age, 41 vs. 33 years, p = 0.012) and more likely to be white (69% vs. 54%, p = 0.036).

Upon activation, platelets generate reactive oxygen species and release proapoptotic and proinflammatory mediators as well as growth factors. In cold hepatic ischemia, adhesion of platelets to endothelial cells mediates sinusoidal endothelial cell apoptosis. Furthermore, platelet-derived serotonin mediates liver regeneration. We hypothesized that platelets may contribute to reperfusion injury and repair after normothermic hepatic ischemia. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of platelets in normothermic hepatic I/R injury using models of impaired platelet function and immune thrombocytopenia. Inhibition of platelet function in mice was achieved via clopidogrel feeding. Immune thrombocytopenia was induced via intraperitoneal injection of anti-CD41 antibody. Platelet-derived serotonin was investigated using mice lacking tryptophan hydroxylase 1. Mice were subjected to 60 minutes of partial hepatic ischemia and various time points of reperfusion. Hepatic injury was determined via AST and histological analysis of the necrotic area as well as leukocyte infiltration. Liver regeneration was determined via proliferating cell nuclear antigen and Ki67 immunohistochemistry. Neither inhibition of platelet function nor platelet depletion led to a reduction of I/R injury. Liver regeneration and repair were significantly impaired in platelet-depleted animals.

Currently, there is very little knowledge available as to how DNA methylation controls the phenotype of hepatic stellate cell (HSC), the key cell type responsible for onset and progression of liver fibrosis.

Expression levels of TET and DNMT enzymes were measured by qRT-PCR and Western blotting. Reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) method was used to examine 5-mC and 5-hmC patterns in quiescent and in vivo activated rat HSC.\nRESULTS: We demonstrate global alteration in 5-mC and 5-hmC and their regulatory enzymes that accompany liver fibrosis and HSC transdifferentiation. Using RRBS, we show exact genomic positions of changed methylation patterns in quiescent and in vivo activated rat HSC.

The purpose of this study, therefore, was to determine the effects of SC5b-9 on myocellular ion homeostasis and its mechanism(s) of action.\nMETHODS: Hindlimb fast-twitch extensor digitorum longus (EDL) was freshly isolated from rats weighing 50 to 70 g and then incubated at 30 degrees C for 60 minutes in normal Krebs-Henseleit buffer (KHB, pH 7.4) containing 10% zymosan-activated rat serum (10 mg/mL at 37 degrees C for 60 minutes) as a source of SC5b-9. Zymosan particles were removed by centrifugation after activation to exclude any noncomplement direct effects. Heat-inactivated rat serum (56 degrees C for 30 minutes) was used as control. EDL muscle was also incubated with pertussis toxin (1 microg/mL), in Ca(2+)-free KHB, with thapsigargin (0.3 or 3 micromol/L), or with ouabain (0.01, 0.1 or 1 micromol/L) before and/or during incubation with 10% zymosan-activated or heat-inactivated rat serum.

The effects of ouabain on myocellular [Na(+)](i) and [K(+)](i) were equivalent in these 2 groups. Zymosan-activated and heat-inactivated rat serum had similar effects on myocellular [K(+)](i) in the presence or absence of pertussis toxin, removal of extracellular Ca(2+) or depletion of intracellular Ca(2+).\nQuestion: Does in vitro complement activation favoring soluble C5b-9 complex formation alter myocellular sodium homeostasis?"}], "answer": "[True].

However, available studies are based on interpretation of static data rather than on direct evidence. Transdifferentiation from acinar to ductal cells has never been confirmed in the adult pancreas.\nMETHODS: Here, we use Cre-loxP-based genetic lineage tracing in vivo to investigate whether transdifferentiation of acinar cells contributes to regeneration and metaplasia in pancreatitis.\nRESULTS: The results show that transdifferentiation does not play a role in regeneration of normal tissue. Acinar cells are regenerated by preexisting acinar cells and not from other cell types. Three different types of metaplastic ductal lesions are observed and analyzed. Whereas the majority of metaplastic lesions are not of acinar origin, acinar-to-ductal transdifferentiation is identified in a minority of mucinous metaplastic lesions.\nQuestion: Does in vivo lineage tracing define the role of acinar-to-ductal transdifferentiation in inflammatory ductal metaplasia?"}], "answer": "[True]. Here, we provide direct evidence that acinar-to-ductal transdifferentiation occurs in the adult pancreas in vivo. However, it accounts for only a minority of metaplastic lesions."}

In animal models, LEV is effective against absence seizures.

All patients were refractory to the conventional therapy for IGE. Four patients received LEV as add-on therapy, and in four, a conversion to LEV monotherapy was undergone. Epileptic activity was analyzed in order to determine spike-wave density as well as median and maximal duration of spike-wave discharges. Each patient underwent a 24h EEG baseline monitoring before starting LEV therapy. A second 24h EEG examination was performed after a mean follow-up period of 136 days.\nRESULTS: Spike-wave density (spikes/h) was reduced by 78% after LEV administration. Median spike-wave duration decreased by 72% (p < 0.05). Maximal spike-wave duration was 6s before, and 1.5s after LEV with a percentage change of 81% (p < 0.05). The four patients on LEV monotherapy evidenced also a considerably improvement after conversion.\nQuestion: Does levetiracetam reduce frequency and duration of epileptic activity in patients with refractory primary generalized epilepsy?"}], "answer": "[True]. This study showed that LEV produces a consistent long-term reduction of interictal epileptic activity in patients with refractory IGE.

After LPS NO is abundantly produced also in the cardiovascular system and may contribute to the development of hypotension and shock. Since the immune response, the synthesis of NO and the regulation of blood pressure (BP) differ between males and females, in the present study the effect of LPS on BP, renal function, the plasma and urinary concentration of the metabolites of NO as well as the splenic and aortic expression of the iNOS gene were compared between male and female rats.\nMETHODS: BP and renal function were measured in anesthetized rats following the i.v. injection of LPS (E. coli, 4 mg/kg). The NO2- and NO3- (metabolites of NO=NOx) concentration was measured by the Griess reaction. The iNOS gene expression was studied by RT-PCR.\nRESULTS: Four hours after LPS, BP of males (n=9) was reduced by 63+/-12 mmHg versus 10+/-4 in females (n=7, P<0.005). Aminoguanidine, a selective inhibitor of iNOS, prevented the reduction of BP in males. The plasma concentration of NOx (P(NOx)), microM) was lower in hypotensive males (128+/-20) than in normotensive females (235+/-29, P<0.005). Males also exhibited lower urinary NOx excretion (U(NOx)V) after LPS (P<0.001 vs. females). Prior castration of males provided protection against hypotension (fall of BP: -4+/-4 mmHg, n=6, P<0.02 versus males) and resulted in higher P(NOx) as well as U(NOx)V (both P<0.001 versus males and not different from females). Prior ovariectomy (n=5) had no influence on the hemodynamic and NOx response to LPS. Male rats displayed enhanced aortic iNOS/beta-actin ratio relative to females after LPS (n=3 in each group, P<0.05).\nQuestion: Does male gender predispose to development of endotoxic shock in the rat?"}], "answer": "[True].

Changes in muscle pH and concentrations of phosphocreatine and adenosine diphosphate (ADP) were measured in phosphorus-31 spectra of calf muscle obtained at rest, throughout incremental work load plantar flexion until exhaustion and during recovery from exercise. Results were compared with those in 15 age-matched control subjects who performed a single study only.\nRESULTS: Before training, phosphocreatine depletion, muscle acidification and the increase in ADP during the 1st 4 min of plantar flexion exercise were all increased (p < 0.04) compared with values in control subjects. Training produced an increase (p < 0.002) in incremental plantar flexion exercise tolerance.

Axillary meristem activity, and hence shoot branching, is regulated by a network of interacting hormonal signals that move through the plant. Among these, auxin, moving down the plant in the main stem, indirectly inhibits axillary bud outgrowth, and an as yet undefined hormone, the synthesis of which in Arabidopsis requires MAX1, MAX3, and MAX4, moves up the plant and also inhibits shoot branching. Since the axillary buds of max4 mutants are resistant to the inhibitory effects of apically supplied auxin, auxin and the MAX-dependent hormone must interact to inhibit branching.\nRESULTS: Here we show that the resistance of max mutant buds to apically supplied auxin is largely independent of the known, AXR1-mediated, auxin signal transduction pathway. Instead, it is caused by increased capacity for auxin transport in max primary stems, which show increased expression of PIN auxin efflux facilitators. The max phenotype is dependent on PIN1 activity, but it is independent of flavonoids, which are known regulators of PIN-dependent auxin transport.\nQuestion: Does the Arabidopsis MAX pathway control shoot branching by regulating auxin transport?"}], "answer": "[True]. The MAX-dependent hormone is a novel regulator of auxin transport. Modulation of auxin transport in the stem is sufficient to regulate bud outgrowth, independent of AXR1-mediated auxin signaling. We therefore propose an additional mechanism for long-range signaling by auxin in which bud growth is regulated by competition between auxin sources for auxin transport capacity in the primary stem."}

Methods-We examined in vitro responses of carotid arteries obtained from wild-type (129/SvEv or C57BL/6; IL-10(+/+)) and IL-10-deficient mice 6 hours after injection of a relatively low dose of LPS (10 microgram).\nRESULTS: Contraction of the carotid artery in response to U46619 was impaired in IL-10-deficient mice treated with LPS compared with LPS-treated controls. After LPS, U46619 (0.03 and 0.1 microgram/mL) contracted the carotid artery by 0.11+/-0.02 (mean+/-SEM) and 0.38+/-0.03 g in wild-type (n=10) and 0.03+/-0.01 and 0.19+/-0.03 g in IL-10-deficient (n=8) mice (P<0.05 versus control).

Similar findings were obtained when phenylephrine was used as a vasoconstricting agent. These findings indicate that LPS produces much greater impairment of contractile responses of the carotid artery in IL-10-deficient mice than in control mice. Impaired contractile function was eliminated by aminoguanidine, suggesting that expression of iNOS is enhanced in arteries from IL-10-deficient mice. In carotid arteries from animals injected with LPS, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) products for iNOS were found more frequently in IL-10-deficient mice than in wild-type mice.

However, the underlying mechanisms of autophagy regulation after ischemia are poorly understood.

In this study, we observed that miR-30a was highly enriched in exosomes from the serum of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients in vivo and culture medium of cardiomyocytes after hypoxic stimulation in vitro. We also found that hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1\u03b1 regulates miR-30a, which efficiently transferred via exosomes between cardiomyocytes after hypoxia. Inhibition of miR-30a or release of exosomes increased the expression of the core autophagy regulators beclin-1, Atg12, and LC3II/LC3I, which contributed to maintaining the autophagic response in cardiomyocytes after hypoxia. Taken together, the present study showed that exosomes from hypoxic cardiomyocytes regulate autophagy by transferring miR-30a in a paracrine manner, which revealed a new pathway of autophagy regulation that might comprise a promising strategy to treat ischemic heart disease.\nQuestion: Does exosomal transfer of miR-30a between cardiomyocytes regulate autophagy after hypoxia?"}], "answer": "[True]. miR-30a is highly enriched in exosomes from the serum of AMI patients.

Type IV pili (tfp) are polarly located filamentous structures which are the major adhesins for attachment of P. aeruginosa to epithelial cells. The extension and retraction of tfp powers a mode of surface translocation termed twitching motility that is involved in biofilm development and also mediates the active expansion of biofilms across surfaces. Extracellular adenosine triphosphate (eATP) is a key \"danger\" signalling molecule that is released by damaged epithelial cells to alert the immune system to the potential presence of pathogens. As P. aeruginosa has a propensity for infecting damaged epithelial tissues we have explored the influence of eATP on tfp biogenesis and twitching motility-mediated biofilm expansion by P. aeruginosa.\nRESULTS: In this study we have found that eATP inhibits P. aeruginosa twitching motility-mediated expansion of interstitial biofilms at levels that are not inhibitory to growth. We have determined that eATP does not inhibit expression of the tfp major subunit, PilA, but reduces the levels of surface assembled tfp. We have also determined that the active twitching zone of expanding P. aeruginosa interstitial biofilms contain large quantities of eATP which may serve as a signalling molecule to co-ordinate cell movements in the expanding biofilm. The inhibition of twitching motility-mediated interstitial biofilm expansion requires eATP hydrolysis and does not appear to be mediated by the Chp chemosensory system.\nQuestion: Does extracellular ATP inhibit twitching motility-mediated biofilm expansion by Pseudomonas aeruginosa?"}], "answer": "[True]. Endogenous eATP produced by P. aeruginosa serves as a signalling molecule to co-ordinate complex multicellular behaviours of this pathogen. Given the propensity for P. aeruginosa to infect damaged epithelial tissues, our observations suggest that eATP released by damaged cells may provide a cue to reduce twitching motility of P. aeruginosa in order to establish infection at the site of damage. Furthermore, eATP produced by P. aeruginosa biofilms and by damaged epithelial cells may play a role in P. aeruginosa pathogenesis by inducing inflammatory damage and fibrosis. Our findings have significant implications in the development and pathogenesis of P. aeruginosa biofilm infections."}

Blood samples were collected before anesthesia and 30, 45, 60, 120, and 240 minutes after anesthesia began. Blood counts for neutrophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes were determined along with lymphocyte subpopulations (T cells, inducer and helper T cells, suppressor and cytotoxic T cells, natural killer cells, and B cells). Plasma concentrations of interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, IL-6, and IL-10 were also measured along with tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 and interferon-\u03b3. Data were analyzed by SPSS 13.0 software using repeated-measures analysis of variance followed by a Bonferroni correction.\nRESULTS: Eighteen patients were enrolled in this study. In the comparison of the immune cell counts during neuroanesthesia, we found that at 30 minutes after anesthesia induction, neutrophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes decreased 18% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 11.0%-24.6%), 34% (95% CI: 16.2%-51.1%), and 39% (95% CI: 29.0%-48.9%) compared with their levels before anesthesia.

Previously, we have demonstrated that region Glu(1811)-Lys(1818) within FVIII light chain constitutes an important binding region for this receptor. We have further found that FVIII light chain and intact FVIII are indistinguishable in their LRP-binding affinities. In apparent contrast to these observations, a second LRP-binding region has been identified within A2 domain region Arg(484)-Phe(509) of FVIII heavy chain.\nOBJECTIVE: In this study, we addressed the relative contribution of FVIII heavy chain in binding LRP.\nRESULTS: Surface plasmon resonance analysis unexpectedly showed that FVIII heavy chain poorly associated to the receptor. The binding to LRP was, however, markedly enhanced upon cleavage of the heavy chain by thrombin. The A2 domain, purified from thrombin-activated FVIII, also showed efficient binding to LRP. Competition studies employing a recombinant antibody fragment demonstrated that region Arg(484)-Phe(509) mediates the enhanced LRP binding after thrombin cleavage.\nQuestion: Is proteolytic cleavage of factor VIII heavy chain required to expose the binding-site for low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein within the A2 domain?"}], "answer": "[True]. We propose that LRP binding of non-activated FVIII is mediated via the FVIII light chain while in activated FVIII both the heavy and light chain contribute to LRP binding."}

Moreover, whether cognitive deficits depend on increased amyloid \u03b2 deposition and tau phosphorylation or are worsened by the apolipoprotein E4 allele remains unknown. Here, we use an experimental model of rmTBI to address these clinical controversies.\nMETHODS: A weight drop rmTBI model was used that results in cognitive deficits without loss of consciousness, seizures, or gross or microscopic evidence of brain damage. Cognitive function was assessed using a Morris water maze (MWM) paradigm. Immunostaining and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were used to assess amyloid \u03b2 deposition and tau hyperphosphorylation. Brain volume and white matter integrity were assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).\nRESULTS: Mice subjected to rmTBI daily or weekly but not biweekly or monthly had persistent cognitive deficits as long as 1 year after injuries. Long-term cognitive deficits were associated with increased astrocytosis but not tau phosphorylation or amyloid \u03b2 (by ELISA); plaques or tangles (by immunohistochemistry); or brain volume loss or changes in white matter integrity (by MRI). APOE4 was not associated with worse MWM performance after rmTBI.\nQuestion: Does clinical correlate in an experimental model of repetitive mild brain injury?"}], "answer": "[True]. Within the vulnerable time period between injuries, rmTBI produces long-term cognitive deficits independent of increased amyloid \u03b2 or tau phosphorylation. In this model, cognitive outcome is not influenced by APOE4 status. The data have implications for the long-term mental health of athletes who suffer multiple concussions."}

Erlotinib decreased VSMC migration dose-dependently and this effect was significant with all doses, p < 0.05. Erlotinib inhibited dose-dependently the proliferation of U937 monocytic cells, p < 0.001. Erlotinib prevented also TPA-induced macrophage differentiation in a dose-dependent way, p < 0.05.\nQuestion: Does epidermal growth factor receptor inhibition by erlotinib prevent vascular smooth muscle cell and monocyte-macrophage function in vitro?"}], "answer": "[True]. Erlotinib significantly prevents VSMC proliferation and migration in vitro. Erlotinib inhibited also significantly both monocyte proliferation and differentiation.

Cytoskeletal rearrangements of circulating neutrophils were assessed by determining the localization of filamentous actin (F-actin). In addition, the number of sequestered neutrophils in the lung capillary and the cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant 1 (CINC-1) levels in the plasma were determined.\nRESULTS: The F-actin rimmed neutrophils in the RE group increased after RE, but did not increase in the other groups.

Classically, one used to link gene with function by genetic or biochemical approaches, a lengthy process that often took years. Phylogenetic distribution profiles, physical clustering, gene fusion, co-expression profiles, structural information and other genomic or post-genomic derived associations can be now used to make very strong functional hypotheses. Here, we illustrate this shift with the analysis of the DUF71/COG2102 family, a subgroup of the PP-loop ATPase family.\nRESULTS: The DUF71 family contains at least two subfamilies, one of which was predicted to be the missing diphthine-ammonia ligase (EC 6.3.1.14), Dph6. This enzyme catalyzes the last ATP-dependent step in the synthesis of diphthamide, a complex modification of Elongation Factor 2 that can be ADP-ribosylated by bacterial toxins. Dph6 orthologs are found in nearly all sequenced Archaea and Eucarya, as expected from the distribution of the diphthamide modification. The DUF71 family appears to have originated in the Archaea/Eucarya ancestor and to have been subsequently horizontally transferred to Bacteria. Bacterial DUF71 members likely acquired a different function because the diphthamide modification is absent in this Domain of Life. In-depth investigations suggest that some archaeal and bacterial DUF71 proteins participate in B12 salvage.\nQuestion: Does comparative genomic analysis of the DUF71/COG2102 family predict roles in diphthamide biosynthesis and B12 salvage?"}], "answer": "[True]. This detailed analysis of the DUF71 family members provides an example of the power of integrated data-miming for solving important \"missing genes\" or \"missing function\" cases and illustrates the danger of functional annotation of protein families by homology alone."}

The condition is characterized histologically by concentric layers of fibrosis around small-caliber arteries and a mixed inflammatory infiltrate dominated by eosinophils. After the serendipitous observation of an elevated serum concentration of IgG4 in 1 patient with EAF, we investigated the hypothesis that EAF is an IgG4-related systemic disease.\nMETHODS: We retrospectively identified 5 EAF cases from our files. Demographic, clinical, and serological data were reviewed, and the histologic features and tissue IgG4 staining patterns were examined on biopsies from each case.\nRESULTS: Patients (2 male, 3 female) ranged in age from 31 to 82 years (mean, 56 y). The extent of disease varied from isolated involvement of the nasal cavity or the lacrimal gland to multicentric disease affecting the sinuses, nasal tract, and lower respiratory tract. The duration of symptoms ranged from 6 months to >20 years. The demographic features of the patients and disease extent were consistent with previously published reports of EAF, except for involvement of the lower respiratory tract in 1 case. Four of the 5 cases showed concentric perivascular fibrosis surrounding small-caliber vascular channels, embedded in an inflammatory infiltrate composed of lymphocytes, plasma cells, and eosinophils. One lacrimal gland biopsy showed a periductal inflammatory infiltrate, and 2 cases showed a storiform pattern of fibrosis. The index case had a serum IgG4 concentration of 1490 mg/dL (normal, 8 to 140 mg/dL). IgG4-positive plasma cells were identified in biopsies from 4 of the 5 cases. The numbers of IgG4-positive plasma cells ranged from 43 to 118 per high-power field, and the IgG4:IgG ratios ranged from 0.68 to 0.97. Neither IgG4-bearing nor IgG-bearing plasma cells were identified in 1 patient, whose longstanding disease was characterized principally by concentric perivascular fibrosis.\nQuestion: Is eosinophilic angiocentric fibrosis a form of IgG4-related systemic disease?"}], "answer": "[True].

Several studies appointed microRNAs (miRs) as essential epigenetic factors in various human diseases; however, little is known about their role in ascending aortic aneurysm. Therefore, the aim of this study was to perform unbiased molecular screening of miRs expression in aneurysmal tissue and establish their functions on a transcriptional level.\nMETHODS: Samples of ascending aortic tissue were obtained from 15 patients, and total RNA was isolated separately from aneurysmal and unaffected aortic tissue obtained from the same patient. Expression of the complete panel of human miRs was assessed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Using bioinformatic tools, 13 genes were selected that were putatively regulated by overexpressed miRs. Expression level of transcripts were evaluated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and correlated with their targeting miRs.\nRESULTS: Overexpression of 10 miRs distinguished aneurysmal tissue from the unchanged one. These miRs were involved in cell senescence (miR-191-5p), maintenance of vascular integrity (miR-126-3p and miR-374-5p), nitric oxide-dependent vascular relaxation (miR-21-5p), smooth muscle differentiation, and contractility (miR-145- 3p, miR-29c-3p, miR-133a-3p, miR-186-5p, miR-143-3p, and miR-24-3p), and correlated with abundance of its miR targets.\nQuestion: Does unbiased Profile of MicroRNA Expression in Ascending Aortic Aneurysm Tissue appoint Molecular Pathways Contributing to the Pathology?"}], "answer": "[True]. Altered expression of particular miRs selectively in the affected tissue indicate their role as factors that trigger pathways of aneurysmal transformation.

In epithelial-like KRAS-mutant lung cancers, this feedback was attributed to ERBB3-mediated activation of MEK and AKT. In contrast, in mesenchymal-like KRAS-mutant lung cancers, FGFR1 was dominantly expressed but suppressed by the negative regulator Sprouty proteins; MEK inhibition led to repression of SPRY4 and subsequent FGFR1-mediated reactivation of MEK and AKT. Therapeutically, the combination of a MEK inhibitor (MEKi) and an FGFR inhibitor (FGFRi) induced cell death in vitro and tumor regressions in vivo These data establish the rationale and a therapeutic approach to treat mesenchymal-like KRAS-mutant lung cancers effectively with clinically available FGFR1 and MAPK inhibitors.\nQuestion: Does epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition define Feedback Activation of Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Signaling Induced by MEK Inhibition in KRAS-Mutant Lung Cancer?"}], "answer": "[True].

NOTCH3-IC strongly induced expression of motility- and mesenchymal marker genes. Many of these genes were significantly coexpressed with NOTCH3 in neuroblastoma, as well as colon, kidney, ovary, and breast tumor series.\nQuestion: Does a NOTCH3 transcriptional module induce cell motility in neuroblastoma?"}], "answer": "[True]. The NOTCH3 transcription factor is a master regulator of motility in neuroblastoma. A subset of neuroblastoma with high expression of NOTCH3 and its downstream-regulated genes has mesenchymal characteristics, increased incidence of metastases, and a poor prognosis."}

Values were averaged to 32 sectors and the total peripapillary mean. Subjects were divided into four groups according to the typical scan score (TSS) provided by the GDxVCC: group 1 TSS, 100; group 2 TSS, 90-99; group 3 TSS, 80-89; group 4 TSS, <80.\nRESULTS: Mean pChTh (\u00b1 SD) in 110 healthy subjects was 141 \u03bcm (\u00b149 \u03bcm). There was a significant correlation between pChTh and TSS (r = 0.608; P < 0.001).

EH patients showed elevated sCD40L levels with a positive correlation with MCP-1 levels.\nQuestion: Does platelet CD40 contribute to enhanced monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 levels in patients with resistant hypertension?"}], "answer": "[True]. Platelets can contribute to enhanced MCP-1 levels in EH. MCP-1 is markedly elevated in serum of EH patients with highest levels in patients with microalbuminuria, one early sign of renal target organ damage. Further studies are required to test whether MCP-1 blocking or antiplatelet strategies may represent new therapeutic options in preventing hypertensive target organ damage."}

Patients in the SS group received 20 mg simvastatin and patients in the IS group received 80 mg simvastatin for 7 days before PCI. Thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) flow grade (TFG), corrected TIMI frame count (CTFC) and TIMI myocardial perfusion grade (TMPG) of the intervened vessel were recorded before and after stent deployment. Creatine kinase (CK) isoenzyme MB, troponin I and plasma level of high sensitive-C reactive protein (hs-CRP), P-selectin and intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM) were measured before and 24 hours after the procedure.\nRESULTS: The TFG after stent deployment was significantly improved with less TIMI 0-1 and more TIMI 3 blood flow in the IS group than in the SS group (all P < 0.05). Patients with no reflow phenomenon were less in the IS group (P < 0.001). The CTFC was lower in the IS group than in the SS group (P < 0.001). TMPG was also improved in the IS group than in the SS group (P = 0.001). Although PCI caused a significant increase in CK-MB 24 hours after the procedure, the elevated CK-MB value was lower in the IS group than in the SS group (18.74 +/- 8.41 vs 21.78 +/- 10.64, P = 0.018).

Actin stress fiber formation occurred within 15 min after LPA treatment and was especially apparent at 2 h. This response was accompanied by higher actin and FAK protein levels. LPA also stimulated IEC-6 migration 3-fold within 24 h. All of these effects were completely inhibited by pertussis toxin.\nQuestion: Does lysophosphatidic acid stimulate intestinal restitution via cytoskeletal activation and remodeling?"}], "answer": "[True]. Exposure of IEC-6 cells to LPA results in significant calcium mobilization and cytoskeletal remodeling within minutes. This activity is accompanied by increased actin and FAK levels. Cellular migration is significantly enhanced by LPA. These responses seem to be due to pertussis-sensitive G-protein-associated receptors. The ability of LPA to potentiate intestinal cell restitution appears, in part, to be mediated by effects on intestinal cell cytoskeletal structure."}

Studies on the mouse Pax6 gene have shown that sequences upstream from the P0 promoter are required for expression in the lens and the pancreas; but there remain discrepancies regarding the precise location of the pancreatic regulatory elements.\nRESULTS: Due to genome duplication in the evolution of ray-finned fishes, zebrafish has two pax6 genes, pax6a and pax6b. While both zebrafish pax6 genes are expressed in the developing eye and nervous system, only pax6b is expressed in the endocrine cells of the pancreas. To investigate the cause of this differential expression, we used a combination of in silico, in vivo and in vitro approaches. We show that the pax6b P0 promoter targets expression to endocrine pancreatic cells and also to enteroendocrine cells, retinal neurons and the telencephalon of transgenic zebrafish. Deletion analyses indicate that strong pancreatic expression of the pax6b gene relies on the combined action of two conserved regulatory enhancers, called regions A and C. By means of gel shift assays, we detected binding of the homeoproteins PDX1, PBX and PREP to several cis-elements of these regions. In constrast, regions A and C of the zebrafish pax6a gene are not active in the pancreas, this difference being attributable to sequence divergences within two cis-elements binding the pancreatic homeoprotein PDX1.\nQuestion: Is expression of zebrafish pax6b in pancreas regulated by two enhancers containing highly conserved cis-elements bound by PDX1 , PBX and PREP factors?"}], "answer": "[True]. Our data indicate a conserved role of enhancers A and C in the pancreatic expression of pax6b and emphasize the importance of the homeoproteins PBX and PREP cooperating with PDX1, in activating pax6b expression in endocrine pancreatic cells.

In particular, MNP-based immobilization of enzymes allows high surface-to-volume ratio, good dispersibility, easy separation of enzymes from the reaction mixture, and reuse by applying an external magnetic field. In a biotechnological perspective, extremophilic enzymes hold great promise as they often can be used under non-conventional harsh conditions, which may result in substrate transformations that are not achievable with normal enzymes. This prompted us to investigate the effect of MNP bioconjugation on the catalytic properties of a thermostable carboxypeptidase from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus (CPSso), which exhibits catalytic properties that are useful in synthetic processes.\nRESULTS: CPSso was immobilized onto silica-coated iron oxide nanoparticles via NiNTA-His tag site-directed conjugation. Following the immobilization, CPSso acquired distinctly higher long-term stability at room temperature compared to the free native enzyme, which, in contrast, underwent extensive inactivation after 72 h incubation, thus suggesting a potential utilization of this enzyme under low energy consumption. Moreover, CPSso conjugation also resulted in a significantly higher stability in organic solvents at 40\u00b0C, which made it possible to synthesize N-blocked amino acids in remarkably higher yields compared to those of free enzyme.\nQuestion: Does immobilization of carboxypeptidase from Sulfolobus solfataricus on magnetic nanoparticles improve enzyme stability and functionality in organic media?"}], "answer": "[True].

Despite its broad evolutionary conservation, the etiology of this aging process is not well understood. However, recent evidence suggests the existence of a link between oxidative stress in the form of progressive membrane lipid peroxidation, declining neuronal electrical excitability and functional decline of the normal aging brain. The current study applies a combination of behavioural and electrophysiological techniques and pharmacological interventions to explore this hypothesis in a gastropod model (Lymnaea stagnalis feeding system) that allows pinpointing the molecular and neurobiological foundations of age-associated long-term memory (LTM) failure at the level of individual identified neurons and synapses.\nRESULTS: Classical appetitive reward-conditioning induced robust LTM in mature animals in the first quartile of their lifespan but failed to do so in animals in the last quartile of their lifespan. LTM failure correlated with reduced electrical excitability of two identified serotonergic modulatory interneurons (CGCs) critical in chemosensory integration by the neural network controlling feeding behaviour. Moreover, while behavioural conditioning induced delayed-onset persistent depolarization of the CGCs known to underlie appetitive LTM formation in this model in the younger animals, it failed to do so in LTM-deficient senescent animals. Dietary supplementation of the lipophilic anti-oxidant \u03b1-tocopherol reversed the effect of age on CGCs electrophysiological characteristics but failed to restore appetitive LTM function.

Patients were treated with tacrolimus (TAC) plus prednisone for 12 months. TAC dose was titrated to achieve a target trough blood concentration of 5-10 ng/ml for the first 6 months and 4-6 ng/ml for the subsequent 6 months. The primary outcomes included complete or partial remission [complete remission (CR): proteinuria <0.3 g/24 h, with serum albumin \u2265 3.5 g/dl and stable renal function; partial remission (PR): proteinuria between 0.3 and 3.5 g/24 h and a decrease of at least 50 % from the baseline level, with serum albumin \u2265 3.0 g/dl and stable renal function]. Secondary end-points included relapse rate, changes of clinical parameters (proteinuria, serum albumin, and lipid profile) and adverse events.\nRESULTS: Twenty-four patients with SRNS were enrolled.

Discovery of functional variants within genes at these loci is required to confirm their role in Alzheimer disease (AD).

We therefore investigated the influence of the novel LOAD risk loci on human brain gene expression.\nMETHODS: We measured gene expression levels in the cerebellum and temporal cortex of autopsied AD subjects and those with other brain pathologies (\u223c400 total subjects). To determine whether any of the novel LOAD risk variants are eSNPs, we tested their cis-association with expression of 6 nearby LOAD candidate genes detectable in human brain (ABCA7, BIN1, CLU, MS4A4A, MS4A6A, PICALM) and an additional 13 genes \u00b1100 kb of these SNPs. To identify additional eSNPs that influence brain gene expression levels of the novel candidate LOAD genes, we identified SNPs \u00b1100 kb of their location and tested for cis-associations.\nRESULTS: CLU rs11136000 (p = 7.81 \u00d7 10(-4)) and MS4A4A rs2304933/rs2304935 (p = 1.48 \u00d7 10(-4)-1.86 \u00d7 10(-4)) significantly influence temporal cortex expression levels of these genes.

Recombination is a very labile force, susceptible to evolutionary and life trait related processes, which have also been correlated with general levels of genetic diversity. For example, in plants, it has been shown that long-lived outcrossing taxa, such as trees, have higher heterozygosity (He) at SSRs and allozymes than selfing or annual species. However, some of these tree taxa have surprisingly low levels of nucleotide diversity at the DNA sequence level, which points to recombination as a potential generator of genetic diversity in these organisms. In this study, we examine how genome-wide and within-gene rates of recombination evolve across plant taxa, determine whether such rates are influenced by the life-form adopted by species, and evaluate if higher genome-wide rates of recombination translate into higher He values, especially in trees.\nRESULTS: Estimates of genome-wide (cM/Mb) recombination rates from 81 higher plants showed a significant phylogenetic signal. The use of different comparative phylogenetic models demonstrated that there is a positive correlation between recombination rate and He (0.83 +/- 0.29), and that trees have higher rates of genome-wide recombination than short-lived herbs and shrubs.

Analysis of serum autoantibodies to tumor antigens combined with gene expression profiling of primary tumors may provide insight into the mechanisms underlying lung carcinogenesis and identify new AD biomarkers.\nMETHODS: T7 phage cDNA libraries were used to identify AZGP1 autoantibodies in the serum of 473 patients (192 ADs, 192 matched controls, and 89 additional ADs for confirmation of findings). AZGP1 mRNA expression was examined in 86 ADs and 10 control lung tissue samples using oligonucleotide microarrays. AZGP1 protein expression was studied in 230 tissue samples (222 ADs; 8 controls) with immunohistochemistry. Kaplan-Meier analyses were used to correlate circulating autoantibody and tissue mRNA production with survival. AD cell lines A549 and SKLU1 were treated with 5-aza-2;-deoxycytidine (5-AZA) and trichostatin A (TSA) to examine the role of promoter methylation and histone deacetylation in the expression of AZGP1. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to quantify the effects of treatment.\nRESULTS: In patients with AD, AZGP1 autoantibodies were observed in 40% of serum samples. Autoantibody production correlated with improved overall 5-year survival (p = 0.002) and improved survival in those with stage I to II disease (p = 0.008). A verification analysis was performed for the survival benefit and found similar results with p values of 0.02 and 0.036, respectively. Although abundant mRNA expression was found in a subset of tumors, mRNA expression did not correlate with prognosis. In normal lung, AZGP1 mRNA and protein expression were low or absent, whereas in AD they were highly expressed in 31.3% and 42.8% of samples, respectively. To determine whether AZGP1 expression in this subset of tumors might be affected by epigenetic mechanisms, low AZGP1-expressing A549 and SKLU1 AD cell lines were treated with TSA and 5-AZA. A 713-fold and 169-fold increase in mRNA expression were noted on treatment with TSA, respectively. Treatment with 5-AZA had minimal effect on AZGP1 mRNA expression.\nQuestion: Does aZGP1 autoantibody predict survival and histone deacetylase inhibitors increase expression in lung adenocarcinoma?"}], "answer": "[True]. The presence of AZGP1 serum autoantibody may be used as a prognostic marker in patients with AD.

LBs are cytoplasmic organelles involved in arachidonic acid metabolism that form eicosanoids in response to inflammatory stimuli. In this study, we assessed the role of salivary gland sonicate (SGS) from Lutzomyia (L.) longipalpis, a Leishmania infantum chagasi vector, in the induction of LBs and eicosanoid production by macrophages in vitro and ex vivo.\nRESULTS: Different doses of L. longipalpis SGS were injected into peritoneal cavities of C57BL/6 mice. SGS induced increased macrophage and neutrophil recruitment into the peritoneal cavity at different time points. Sand fly saliva enhanced PGE\u2082 and LTB\u2084 production by harvested peritoneal leukocytes after ex vivo stimulation with a calcium ionophore. At three and six hours post-injection, L. longipalpis SGS induced more intense LB staining in macrophages, but not in neutrophils, compared with mice injected with saline. Moreover, macrophages harvested by peritoneal lavage and stimulated with SGS in vitro presented a dose- and time-dependent increase in LB numbers, which was correlated with increased PGE\u2082 production. Furthermore, COX-2 and PGE-synthase co-localized within the LBs induced by L. longipalpis saliva. PGE\u2082 production by macrophages induced by SGS was abrogated by treatment with NS-398, a COX-2 inhibitor. Strikingly, SGS triggered ERK-1/2 and PKC-\u03b1 phosphorylation, and blockage of the ERK-1/2 and PKC-\u03b1 pathways inhibited the SGS effect on PGE\u2082 production by macrophages.\nQuestion: Does lutzomyia longipalpis saliva trigger lipid body formation and prostaglandin E\u2082 production in murine macrophages?"}], "answer": "[True]. In sum, our results show that L. longipalpis saliva induces lipid body formation and PGE\u2082 production by macrophages ex vivo and in vitro via the ERK-1/2 and PKC-\u03b1 signaling pathways. This study provides new insights regarding the pharmacological mechanisms whereby L. longipalpis saliva influences the early steps of the host's inflammatory response."}

Mean tumor size was 1.3 cm (range, 0.8-3.7 cm). All patients underwent unilateral modified neck dissection. Prior to surgery, patients had, by random assignment, identification and biopsy of SLNs by methylene blue, alone (Group 1), or by sulfur colloid labeled with 99 m Technetium, gamma-probe guided surgery and methylene blue (Group 2).\nRESULTS: In the methylene blue group, SLNs were identified in 39 of 45 patients (86.7%).

Compared to a single technique, there was a significantly higher SLN identification rate for the combined technique in younger female with ipsilateral, low-risk PTC (T1-2N0M0). Thus, a combined SLN biopsy technique seems to more accurately stage lymph nodes, with better identification of SLN located out of the central compartment.

Stroke-prone renovascular hypertensive rats were randomly divided into a control group, an exercise training group, and a sham group. Motor function was measured using the grip strength test. Axon and myelin remodeling markers, growth-associated protein 43, myelin basic protein, Tau, and amyloid precursor protein were detected by immunofluorescence.

After inhibiting protein synthesis using cycloheximide (CHX), we found that levels of both megalin and ClC5 were lower in Cd-challenged cells than in cells treated with Cd or CHX only, which is consistent with reduced translation and/or posttranslational down-regulation. Moreover, Cd-induced degradation of megalin and ClC5 was abolished by the lysosomal pathway inhibitor bafilomycin A-1 but not by the proteasome system blocker MG-132, suggesting that the enhanced proteolysis was occurring via lysosomes.

To examine this relationship, we used a murine model of ethanol dependence (Becker and Lopez, 2004 Alcohol Clin Exp Res 28:1829; Lopez and Becker, 2005 Psychopharmacology (Berl) 181:688) and compared animals with sham lesions and electrolytic lesions of the CeA and BNSTLP.\nMETHODS: Male C57BL/6J (B6) mice were first acclimated to a limited-access 2-bottle-choice preference procedure.

The air-control procedure produced no change in ethanol intake when compared to baseline consumption. In contrast, intermittent ethanol vapor exposure increased ethanol consumption by almost 50%. The increase in consumption was associated with an increase in total fluid volume consumed and no change in ethanol preference. Lesions of both the BNSTLP and CeA significantly decreased baseline ethanol consumption, the former by decreasing fluid consumption and the latter by decreasing ethanol preference.

The results obtained clearly demonstrate that the cEA has a role in the regulation of ethanol consumption in the limited-access procedure.

After simulation of ischemia and reperfusion periods, the animals were randomized to deep postoperative sedation with either propofol (n = 6) or dexmedetomidine (n = 6). Flap tissue metabolism was monitored by microdialysis and tissue-oxygen partial pressure. Glucose, lactate, and pyruvate concentrations were analyzed from the dialysate every 30 min for 4 h.\nRESULTS: Mean arterial blood pressure was higher in the dexmedetomidine group (P = 0.036). Flap tissue metabolism remained stable throughout the experiment as measured by lactate-pyruvate and lactate-glucose ratios (median ranges 14.3-24.5 for lactate-pyruvate and 0.3-0.6 for lactate-glucose) and by tissue-oxygen partial pressure, and no differences were found between groups.\nQuestion: Does deep sedation with dexmedetomidine in a porcine model compromise the viability of free microvascular flap as depicted by microdialysis and tissue oxygen tension?"}], "answer": "[False].

Because the DBT detector panel is typically stationary during the source rotation, antiscatter grids are not generally compatible with DBT; thus, a software-based scatter correction is required. This work proposes a fully iterative scatter correction method that uses a novel fast Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) with a tissue-composition ratio estimation technique for DBT imaging.\nMETHODS: To apply MCS to scatter estimation, the material composition in each voxel should be known. To overcome the lack of prior accurate knowledge of tissue composition for DBT, a tissue-composition ratio is estimated based on the observation that the breast tissues are principally composed of adipose and glandular tissues. Using this approximation, the composition ratio can be estimated from the reconstructed attenuation coefficients, and the scatter distribution can then be estimated by MCS using the composition ratio. The scatter estimation and image reconstruction procedures can be performed iteratively until an acceptable accuracy is achieved. For practical use, (i) the authors have implemented a fast MCS using a graphics processing unit (GPU), (ii) the MCS is simplified to transport only x-rays in the energy range of 10-50 keV, modeling Rayleigh and Compton scattering and the photoelectric effect using the tissue-composition ratio of adipose and glandular tissues, and (iii) downsampling is used because the scatter distribution varies rather smoothly.\nRESULTS: The authors have demonstrated that the proposed method can accurately estimate the scatter distribution, and that the contrast-to-noise ratio of the final reconstructed image is significantly improved. The authors validated the performance of the MCS by changing the tissue thickness, composition ratio, and x-ray energy. The authors confirmed that the tissue-composition ratio estimation was quite accurate under a variety of conditions. Our GPU-based fast MCS implementation took approximately 3 s to generate each angular projection for a 6 cm thick breast, which is believed to make this process acceptable for clinical applications.

Consequently, reverting the 82M mutation back to wild-type (82I) in a subtype G isolate from a patient that failed therapy with multiple other PR mutations did result in significant increases in susceptibility towards indinavir and lopinavir and minor increases in susceptibility towards amprenavir and atazanavir. The presence of the 82M mutation also slightly decreased viral replication, whether it was in the genetic background of subtype B or subtype G.\nQuestion: Does hIV-1 protease mutation 82M contribute to phenotypic resistance to protease inhibitors in subtype G?"}], "answer": "[True]. Our results suggest that 82M has an impact on PI susceptibility and that this effect is not due to a compensatory effect on the replication capacity. Because 82M is not observed as a polymorphism in any subtype, these observations support the inclusion of 82M in drug resistance interpretation systems and PI mutation lists."}

We aimed to understand the relationship between CTNNB1 mutation types, tumor phenotype, and level of \u00df-catenin activation in malignant transformation. To this purpose, CTNNB1 mutation spectrum was analyzed in 220 HCAs, 373 HCCs, and 17 borderline HCA/HCC lesions. \u00df-catenin activation level was assessed in tumors by quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry (IHC), in cellulo by TOP-Flash assay. Overall, \u00df-catenin activity was higher in malignant mutated tumors, compared to adenomas, and this was related to a different spectrum of CTNNB1 mutations in HCCs and HCAs. In benign tumors, we defined three levels of \u00df-catenin activation related to specific mutations: (1) S45, K335, and N387 mutations led to weak activation; (2) T41 mutations were related to moderate activity; and (3) highly active mutations included exon 3 deletions and amino acid substitutions within the \u00df-TRCP binding site (D32-S37). Accordingly, in vitro, K335I and N387K mutants showed a lower activity than S33C. Tumors with highly active mutations demonstrated strong/homogeneous glutamine synthase (GS) staining and were associated with malignancy. In contrast, weak mutants demonstrated heterogeneous pattern of GS staining and were more frequent in HCAs except for the S45 mutants identified similarly in 20% of mutated HCAs and HCCs; however, in most of the HCCs, the weak S45 mutant alleles were duplicated, resulting in a final high \u00df-catenin activity.\nQuestion: Does genotype-phenotype correlation of CTNNB1 mutations reveal different \u00df-catenin activity associated with liver tumor progression?"}], "answer": "[True]. High \u00df-catenin activity driven by specific CTNNB1 mutations and S45 allele duplication is associated with malignant transformation.

Despite the clinical importance of granulation tissue formation in the early stage of wound healing, surprisingly little is known about the molecular identity of signals leading to granulation tissue invasion of a wound space. Methods. A ventral hernia, surgically created in the abdominal wall of 15 swine, was repaired using silicone sheeting and skin closure. An osmotic minipump, inserted in a remote subcutaneous pocket, delivered saline (n = 5), an irrelevant control antibody (n = 5), or neutralizing anti-VEGF antibody (n = 5) into the wound environment. Serial ultrasonography on Days 2, 4, 7, 9, 11, and 14 was used to determine the dimensions of the subcutaneous granulation tissue and wound fluid compartment. VEGF and transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1) levels in serial wound fluid samples were quantitated by ELISA. On Day 14, animals were sacrificed and the abdominal wall was harvested for histologic, biochemical, and molecular analyses.\nRESULTS: In animals receiving saline or an irrelevant antibody, a nearly linear 4-fold increase in granulation tissue thickness and 7-fold increase in wound fluid volume were measured over the 14-day study interval. In contrast, in animals receiving anti-VEGF neutralizing antibody, Day 14 granulation tissue thickness and wound fluid volume measurements were essentially unchanged from Day 2 values. Moreover, in the anti-VEGF animals, ultrasonography was unable to resolve the \"angiogenic zone\" typical of both controls, and correspondingly, wound vessel count and vascular surface area estimates derived from image analysis of histological sections were 3-fold lower in the anti-VEGF animals compared with the saline and antibody controls. Finally, VEGF levels in wound fluid detectable by ELISA analysis were strikingly (10-fold) reduced in anti-VEGF animals on Postsurgery Days 7-14. In contrast, TGF-beta1 levels were unaffected by the anti-VEGF treatment.\nQuestion: Does antibody neutralization of vascular endothelial growth factor inhibit wound granulation tissue formation?"}], "answer": "[True].

Compared with control subjects, patients with Type 2 diabetes had a smaller phase angle at 100 kHz (men: 5.2\u00b0 vs. 4.5\u00b0, P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001; women: 4.8\u00b0 vs. 4.2\u00b0, P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) and a smaller phase angle at 50 kHz (men: 5.9\u00b0 vs. 5.3\u00b0, P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001; women: 5.4\u00b0 vs. 4.8\u00b0, P\u00a0=\u00a00.0001), but a larger phase angle at 5 kHz (men: 2.0\u00b0 vs. 2.6\u00b0, P\u00a0=\u00a00.0001; women: 2.3\u00b0 vs. 3.0\u00b0, P\u00a0=\u00a00.00001). Phase angle ratios better discriminated between patients and control subjects than phase angles alone (phase angle at 5\u00a0kHz/ phase angle at 50 kHz ratio, P\u00a0=\u00a01.51\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010(-16) ; phase angle at 5kHz/phase angle at 100\u00a0kHz ratio, P\u00a0=\u00a02.13\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010(-15) ). No differences were found among phase angles in the different therapy groups. In patients with diabetes, the phase angle at 50 kHz and the phase angle at 100 kHz correlated inversely with duration of disease (men: P\u00a0=\u00a00.026, P\u00a0=\u00a00.016; women: only phase angle at 100 kHz, P\u00a0=\u00a00.003) and with HbA1c concentration (men: P\u00a0=\u00a00.010, P\u00a0=\u00a00.001; women: P\u00a0=\u00a00.007, P\u00a0=\u00a00.043).\nQuestion: Does bioimpedance phase angle indicate catabolism in Type 2 diabetes?"}], "answer": "[True].

Intraventricular fibrinolysis (IVF) with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) is an emerging treatment strategy for such patients. However, experimental studies suggest that rtPA may exert proedematous effects and lead to increased perihemorrhagic edema (PHE) after ICH. We aimed to compare the course of PHE after ICH between patients who received IVF with rtPA and controls matched for ICH volume.\nMETHODS: Patients were identified retrospectively from our institutional ICH database. Sixty-four patients with ICH and intraventricular hemorrhage who were treated with IVF were compared with 64 controls, who did not receive IVF, matched for ICH volume. The course of PHE was assessed on computed tomography scans (day 1, days 2 and 3, days 4-6, 7-9, and 10-12) using a threshold-based semiautomatic volumetric algorithm. Relative PHE was calculated as a ratio of PHE volume and initial ICH volume.\nRESULTS: The matching algorithm resulted in similar mean ICH volumes in both groups (20.01 \u00b1 17.5 mL, IVF vs 20.08 \u00b1 17.1 mL, control). Intraventricular hemorrhage volume was larger in the IVF group (26.8 \u00b1 19.2 mL vs 9.2 \u00b1 13.4 mL). The mean total rtPA dose used for IVF was 8 \u00b1 6 mg. PHE increased over time in both groups until day 12. At all investigated time points, there was no significant difference in relative PHE between the IVF group and controls (F=0.39; P=0.844).\nQuestion: Does intraventricular fibrinolysis increase perihemorrhagic edema after intracerebral hemorrhage?"}], "answer": "[False]. IVF with rtPA did not lead to a relevant increase in PHE after ICH. rtPA doses used in the current study seem to be safe regarding PHE."}

In this study, we determined the contribution of rod pathways to normal refractive development and form deprivation (FD) myopia by testing Gnat1(-/-) mice, which lack functional rods due to a mutation in rod transducin-\u03b1.\nMETHODS: Refractive development was measured in Gnat1(-/-) (n = 30-36) and wild-type (WT) mice (n = 5-9) from 4 to 12 weeks of age. FD was induced monocularly from 4 weeks of age using head-mounted diffuser goggles (Gnat1(-/-), n = 9-10; WT, n = 7-8). Refractive state and ocular biometry were obtained weekly using a photorefractor, 1310 nm optical coherence tomography, and partial coherence interferometry. We measured retinal dopamine and its metabolite, DOPAC, using HPLC.\nRESULTS: During normal development, the refractions of WT mice started at 5.36 \u00b1 0.68 diopters (D) and became more hyperopic before plateauing at 7.78 \u00b1 0.64 D. In contrast, refractions in Gnat1(-/-) mice were stable at 7.39 \u00b1 1.22 D across all ages. Three weeks of FD induced a 2.54 \u00b1 0.77 D myopic shift in WT mice, while Gnat1(-/-) mice did not respond to FD at any age. Axial lengths of Gnat1(-/-) and WT mice increased with age, but differences between genotypes or with goggling did not reach statistical significance and fell within the precision of the instruments. The DOPAC levels were significantly lower in Gnat1(-/-) mice from 2 to 12 weeks of age with DOPAC/dopamine ratio peaking earlier in Gnat1(-/-) compared to WT mice. No differences in dopamine were seen in response to FD or between genotypes.\nQuestion: Does visually-driven ocular growth in mice require functional rod photoreceptors?"}], "answer": "[True]. Functional rod photoreceptors are critical to normal refractive development and the response to FD in mice. Dopamine levels may not directly modulate the refractive state of the mouse eye, but tonic levels of dopamine during development may determine susceptibility to myopia."}

Here, we investigate the novel polymorphisms in exon 12, that approximate the oxygen-dependent degradation domain of HIF-1alpha in five cell lines and 28 patients with oral squamous carcinomas. Moreover, we assess for the presence of polymorphisms and mutations in TSC1 and TSC2, to ascertain if dysregulation of such might complement HIF-1alpha expression.\nRESULTS: Denaturing high pressure liquid chromatography (DHPLC) analysis on PCR fragments in exon 12 of HIF-1alpha from 28 patients with OSCC revealed that 6 of 28 patients had mismatched heteroduplex patterns. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes and direct sequencing showed that in 5 of the six cases these changes represented polymorphisms while, one case was a somatic mutation. Analyses of TSC1 and TSC2 revealed heteroduplexes in exons: TSC1 exon 17; TSC2 exons 36, 40, and 41. The relative levels of HIF-1alpha were significantly greater for tumors possessing a HIF-1alpha polymorphism or mutation within exon 12, whereas tumors possessing a deletion or polymorphism in TSC1/TSC2 displayed a trend for higher levels of HIF-1alpha. Western blot analyses for HIF-1alpha, TSC1 and TSC2 in five SCC cell lines revealed high levels of HIF-1alpha in SCC cells possessing TSC1 and/or TSC2 mutations. Wild-type TSC2 cells targeted with siRNA to TSC2 exhibited increased levels of HIF-1alpha. Transfection of a HIF-1alpha mutant produced higher levels of HIF-1alpha in TSC1/TSC2 mutant cell lines than in wild type cells. TSC1/TSC2 mutant cell lines administered Rapamycin blocked S6 phorphorylation and diminished the levels of HIF-1alpha to those observed in cell lines with wild type TSC1/TSC2.\nQuestion: Are hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha polymorphisms and TSC1/2 mutations complementary in head and neck cancers?"}], "answer": "[True].

Dysregulation of lncRNAs is discovered in various tumor tissues and cancer cells where they can serve as oncogenes or tumor suppressors. Long non-coding RNA HOXD-AS (HOXD cluster antisense RNA 1) has recently been identified to be involved in the development of several cancers including neuroblastoma, adenocarcinomas and breast cancer. However, the role of HOXD-AS1 in bladder cancer remains unknown.\nMETHODS: The synthetic tetracycline-controllable shRNA was used to modulate the level of HOXD-AS1 by adding different concentrations of doxycycline (dox). RT-qPCR was used to detect the expression level of HOXD-AS1. Cell proliferation was determined by CCK-8 assay and EdU incorporation experiment when HOXD-AS1 was knocked down. We used wound-healing assay for detecting the effect of HOXD-AS1 on cell migration. Eventually, cell apoptosis was determined by caspase 3 ELISA assay and flow cytometry assay.\nRESULTS: In this study, we found that the expression level of HOXD-AS1 was significantly increased in bladder cancer tissues and cells. Furthermore, high expression of HOXD-AS1 was significantly related to tumor size, histological grade and TNM stage. In vitro assays confirmed that knockdown of HOXD-AS1 suppressed cell proliferation/migration and increased the rate of apoptotic cell in bladder cancer cells. At last, we used the important element of synthetic biology, tetracycline(tet)-controllable switch, to construct tet-controllable shRNA vectors which can modulate the expression of HOXD-AS1 in a dosage-dependent manner.\nQuestion: Does synthetic tetracycline-controllable shRNA targeting long non-coding RNA HOXD-AS1 inhibit the progression of bladder cancer?"}], "answer": "[True]. Our research suggested that high expression of HOXD-AS1 may be involved in the bladder cancer carcinogenesis through inhibiting the phenotypes and activating endogenous cancer-related molecular pathways. Therefore, HOXD-AS1 may act as an oncogene and provide a potential attractive therapeutic target for bladder cancer. In addition, the synthetic tetracycline-controllable shRNA may provide a novel method for cancer research in vitro assays."}

In order to study hemodynamics and left ventricular (LV) and annular dynamics that determine suture tension, the central edge of the mitral leaflets was approximated with a miniature force transducer to measure leaflet tension (T) at the leaflet approximation point.\nMETHODS: Eight sheep were studied under open-chest conditions immediately after surgical placement of a force transducer and implantation of radiopaque markers on the left ventricle and mitral annulus (MA). Hemodynamic variables were altered by two caval occlusion steps (deltaV1 and deltaV2) and dobutamine infusion. Three-dimensional marker coordinates were obtained by simultaneous biplane videofluoroscopy to measure LV volume, MA area (MAA) and septal-lateral (SL) annular dimension throughout the cardiac cycle.\nRESULTS: At baseline, peak Alfieri stitch tension (0.30 +/- 0.18 N) was observed 96 +/- 61 ms prior to end-diastole coincident with peak annular SL diameter (98 +/- 58 ms before end-diastole). Dobutamine infusion decreased suture tension (from 0.30 +/- 0.18 N to 0.20 +/- 0.12 N, p = 0.01), although peak systolic pressure increased significantly (138 +/- 19 versus 115 +/- 14 mmHg; p = 0.03). A regression model was fitted with the goal of interpreting the hemodynamic and geometric predictors of tension as their influence varied with time: Tt (N) = 0.1916 + 0.2115 x SL (cm) - 0.1996 x MAA/SL (cm2/cm) + ft x LVP (mmHg), where Tt is tension at any time during the cardiac cycle and ft is the time-varying coefficient of LVP.\nQuestion: Does mitral annular size predict Alfieri stitch tension in mitral edge-to-edge repair?"}], "answer": "[True]. Tension on the leaflets in the edge-to-edge repair is determined primarily by MA SL size, and paradoxically is lower when the contractile state is enhanced. This indicates that annular and/or LV dilatation increase stitch tension and may adversely affect durability of the repair if concomitant ring annuloplasty is not performed."}

Sixteen weeks after 6-OHDA administration to newborn pigs, we found substantial myocardial adrenergic denervation associated with beta-adrenergic receptor (beta AR) downregulation. Despite decreased beta AR number, the dose of isoproterenol yielding 50% maximal heart rate change (ED50) was decreased, and heart rates during exercise showed increased responsiveness despite decreased circulating catecholamines. Thus, stimulation of fewer receptors yielded an increased response, implying improved signal transduction efficiency. Competitive binding studies with isoproterenol showed an increased proportion of beta AR with high-affinity binding in myocardial membranes from 6-OHDA pigs, suggesting that interaction between beta AR and cardiac G, may contribute to improved signal transduction efficiency. However, measures of adenylyl cyclase activity indicated marked reduction in beta AR-dependent and G2-dependent cAMP production in myocardial membranes from denervated animals despite a normal amount of cardiac Gs and decreased Gi.\nQuestion: Does myocardial adrenergic denervation supersensitivity depend on a postreceptor mechanism not linked with increased cAMP production?"}], "answer": "[True]. We have demonstrated that substantial, long-term myocardial adrenergic denervation is possible using 6-OHDA. Denervation supersensitivity in this model does not depend on enhanced cAMP stimulation but rather depends on postreceptor elements in the beta AR-responsive pathway that may be independent of Gs-activated adenylyl cyclase activity. In this model of adrenergic denervation supersensitivity, beta-receptors, through Gs, may be linked to an alternative effector that drives heart rate responsiveness."}

It was reported that monomeric purified PS has poor PS-direct and that a subpopulation of multimeric purified PS has high PS-direct and high affinity for phospholipids. We independently examined the relative PS-direct and affinity for phospholipids of monomeric and multimeric PS and we obtained contrasting results.\nRESULTS: Unpurified recombinant protein S (rPS) was monomeric and had PS-direct potency similar to that of both PS in plasma and multimeric affinity-purified PS, as measured in plasma assays for PS-direct and in thrombin-generation assays. Multimers of unpurified rPS were not induced by ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), pH 2.5, NaSCN, or barium adsorption/elution. Multimers were induced by chromatography in the presence of EDTA and thus may be concentration-dependent. In contrast to a different report, monomers, dimers, trimers, and higher-order PS forms were clearly separated in sedimentation velocity experiments and multimers were not dissociated by adding Ca(2+). Active plasma-derived and recombinant immunoaffinity-purified PS were fractionated into monomers and multimers. On a mass basis, monomers and multimers had similar specific PS-direct and ability to compete with prothrombinase components (factors Xa/Va) for limiting phospholipids.

Release of hemoglobin was quantified spectrophotometrically. The concentration of bile salt monomers and simple micelles in the intermixed micellar aqueous phase (IMMC) was determined by centrifugal ultrafiltration.\nRESULTS: The degree of hemolysis depended on the hydrophobicity of the bile salts and was progressive over time. Addition of lecithin reduced the hemolytic effects of 20 mM TCA or 2 mM TDCA in a concentration-dependent manner at both 30 min and 4 h. Increasing the concentration of lecithin progressively reduced the IMMC of TDCA.

Persons with C carrier genotypes of HSP70-Hom were significantly less susceptible to gastric cancer than those with the TT genotype (OR\u00a0= 0.29; 95% CI\u00a0= 0.09-0.87; p\u00a0= 0.027). The C carrier genotype was associated with lower PGI concentrations but none of the polymorphisms were associated with PGI/PGII.\nQuestion: Are polymorphisms in genes coding for HSP-70 associated with gastric cancer and duodenal ulcer in a population at high risk of gastric cancer in Costa Rica?"}], "answer": "[True]. Polymorphisms of HSP70 genes are associated with the development of gastric cancer and duodenal ulcers in a population at high risk for gastric cancer in Costa Rica."}

In order to determine how these factors interact to regulate the host immune response and ecological succession of the colon tissue-associated microbiota, we investigated the temporal interaction between the microbiota and the host following disruption of the colonic epithelial barrier.\nRESULTS: Oral administration of DSS was applied as a mechanistic model of environmental damage of the colon and the resulting inflammation characterized for various parameters over time in WT and Nod2 KO mice.\nRESULTS: In WT mice, DSS damage exposed the host to the commensal flora and led to a migration of the tissue-associated bacteria from the epithelium to mucosal and submucosal layers correlating with changes in proinflammatory cytokine profiles and a progressive transition from acute to chronic inflammation of the colon. Tissue-associated bacteria levels peaked at day 21 post-DSS and declined thereafter, correlating with recruitment of innate immune cells and development of the adaptive immune response. Histological parameters, immune cell infiltration and cytokine biomarkers of inflammation were indistinguishable between Nod2 and WT littermates following DSS, however, Nod2 KO mice demonstrated significantly higher tissue-associated bacterial levels in the colon. DSS damage and Nod2 genotype independently regulated the community structure of the colon microbiota.\nQuestion: Do host genetics and environmental factors regulate ecological succession of the mouse colon tissue-associated microbiota?"}], "answer": "[True]. The results of these experiments demonstrate the integration of environmental and genetic factors in the ecological succession of the commensal flora in mammalian tissue.

MMP-9 also mediates macrophage and collagen content of the resolving thrombus and bone-marrow derived MMP-9 plays a role in resolution of thrombus mass. These disparate effects of MMP-9 on various aspects of thrombus illustrate the complexity of individual protease function on biomechanical and morphometric aspects of thrombus resolution."}

Simultaneous to blood sampling, aliquots of the albumin dialysate were taken between the elements of the dialysate circuit.\nRESULTS: Fischer's Index in systemic blood increased during MARS by 24% (from 1.44 to 1.79, P < 0.001; mean treatment duration, 5.5 h). Systemic tryptophan level was significantly reduced at the same time (-25%, n = 8). Amino acid removal rates from plasma during a single dialyser passage ranged from 10 to 53%. In particular, AAA were preferentially removed (42-44% throughout treatment), while BCAA removal was 28-46% initially and later declined to 24-28%. A maximum concentration gradient between plasma and dialysate was maintained for the AAA throughout treatment through their apparently complete removal by the charcoal adsorber. Conversely, BCAA removal at both adsorbers was only minor. As a result, Fischer's Index showed a significant increase in the processed plasma, which became even more pronounced with increasing treatment duration.\nQuestion: Is amino acid dysbalance in liver failure favourably influenced by recirculating albumin dialysis ( MARS )?"}], "answer": "[True]. MARS enables an elevation of a pathologically decreased Fischer's Index as well as a reduction of systemic tryptophan levels in patients with liver failure. The effects of MARS on plasma amino acid dysbalance may contribute to an improvement of hepatic encephalopathy."}

We conclude that IFN-gamma metabolic responses were functional in both cell lines, but IFN-gamma anti-proliferative responses functioned only in tumor cells.\nQuestion: Does transformation of SV40-immortalized human uroepithelial cells by 3-methylcholanthrene increase IFN- and Large T Antigen-induced transcripts?"}], "answer": "[True]. Synergism of SV40 with 3-MC or other environmental carcinogens may be of concern as SV40 is now endemic in 2-5.9% of the U.S. population. In addition, SV40-immortalization is a generally-accepted method used in many research materials, but the possibility of off-target effects in studies carried out using these cells has not been considered. We hope that our work will stimulate further study of this important phenomenon."}

The identification of patients at risk is therefore of major interest. We sought to assess the prognostic value of impaired cardiac autonomic nervous activity in patients with congenital cardiac disease.\nMETHODS: Forty-three consecutive patients with congenital cardiac disease were included in this prospective study. Parameters of heart rate turbulence and heart rate variability were calculated from Holter electrocardiograms. In addition, serum brain natriuretic peptide levels were measured. A combined end point of sudden cardiac death or nearly missed sudden cardiac death was used.\nRESULTS: During a mean follow up of 27 +/- 12.7 months, 5 patients died, and another 2 were successfully resuscitated. On univariate analysis, both brain natriuretic peptide levels and parameters of heart rate variability and heart rate turbulence were associated with impaired prognosis. On multivariate analysis, pathologic heart rate turbulence was found to be the strongest independent risk stratifier (hazard ratio, 61.5; P < .001).\nQuestion: Does impaired cardiac autonomic nervous activity predict sudden cardiac death in patients with operated and unoperated congenital cardiac disease?"}], "answer": "[True]. Impaired cardiac autonomic nervous activity is associated with an increased risk of sudden cardiac death in congenital cardiac disease.

In addition, Cdc2 and Cyclin A cooperatively inhibit transcriptional activation by the essential S phase regulator E2F. Cdc2 binds to E2F in vitro, and post-transcriptionally promotes its accumulation in vivo.

Concentrations of IL-1B, IL-6, and IL-8 in the culture supernatants were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).\nRESULTS: In this study, we found that both P gingivalis and its LPS treatment increased the expression of TRAF6 and proinflammatory cytokine production in HPDLCs. In addition, we used siRNA for TRAF6, and the inhibition of TRAF6 expression reduced the production of proinflammatory cytokines in HPDLCs stimulated with P gingivalis and its LPS.\nQuestion: Does tNF receptor-associated factor 6 suppression inhibit inflammatory response to Porphyromonas gingivialis in human periodontal ligament cells?"}], "answer": "[True]. The results suggested that TRAF6 may be a key molecule to control proinflammatory cytokine production induced by P gingivalis and its LPS. TRAF6 suppression may inhibit inflammatory responses in HPDLCs infected by P gingivalis and its LPS."}

Oxygen consumption was continuously measured by an indirect calorimeter, Deltatrac II MBM-200 Metabolic Monitor (Datex Division Instrumentarium, Helsinki, Finland). Oxygen delivery and cardiac output were calculated from oxygen consumption and the arterial and mixed venous oxygen contents sampled before and every 30 minutes after cardiopulmonary bypass. Oxygen extraction ratio was derived by the ratio of oxygen consumption to oxygen delivery. Arterial blood lactate was measured before and every 30 minutes after cardiopulmonary bypass. Six animals were randomly assigned to receive an intravenous infusion of insulinlike growth factor 1 at 1.2 mg/h from 1 to 6 hours after cardiopulmonary bypass; the remaining 6 served as a control group.\nRESULTS: Relative to the control group, intravenous infusion of insulin-like growth factor 1 significantly reduced oxygen consumption (P =.02) and increased cardiac output (P =.016) and oxygen delivery (P =.049) during the first 6 hours after surgery with hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass.

In many countries this has led to the detection of cases of atypical scrapie which, unlike classical scrapie, might not be contagious. EU legislation requires, that following detection of a scrapie case, control measures including further testing take place in affected flocks, including the culling of genotype susceptible to classical scrapie. This might result in the detection of additional cases. The aim of this study was to investigate the occurrence of additional cases in flocks affected by atypical scrapie using surveillance data collected in Europe in order to ascertain whether atypical scrapie, is contagious.\nRESULTS: Questionnaires were used to collect, at national level, the results of active surveillance and testing associated with flock outbreaks in 12 European countries. The mean prevalence of atypical scrapie was 5.5 (5.0-6.0) cases per ten thousand in abattoir surveillance and 8.1 (7.3-9.0) cases per ten thousand in fallen stock. By using meta-analysis, on 11 out of the 12 countries, we found that the probability of detecting additional cases of atypical scrapie in positive flocks was similar to the probability observed in animals slaughtered for human consumption (odds ratio, OR = 1.07, CI95%: 0.70-1.63) or among fallen stock (OR = 0.78, CI95%: 0.51-1.2). In contrast, when comparing the two scrapie types, the probability of detecting additional cases in classical scrapie positive flocks was significantly higher than the probability of detecting additional cases in atypical scrapie positive flocks (OR = 32.4, CI95%: 20.7-50.7).\nQuestion: Is the prevalence of atypical scrapie in sheep from positive flocks higher than in the general sheep population in 11 European countries?"}], "answer": "[False]. These results suggest that atypical scrapie is not contagious or has a very low transmissibility under natural conditions compared with classical scrapie.

Inhibition of either alkaline phosphatase activity or Na/Pi co-transport abolished this effect. Compared to incubation with control human serum, BVSMC cultured with uremic sera had increased mineral deposition. Uremic sera also increased alkaline phosphatase activity and osteopontin expression in BVSMC.

However the correlation between telomerase activity and hTERT mRNA expression has not been previously examined in human breast cancer. The present study aims to quantitatively measure the expression of hTERT mRNA and telomerase activity in human breast cancer and examine the relationship between these parameters. Furthermore the associations with other parameters including estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PgR) status, DNA ploidy, and S-phase fraction (SPF) are also examined.\nMETHODS: RNA was extracted from 18 breast carcinomas and hTERT mRNA expressions were estimated by reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) and Taqman methodology. These tumours had already been analysed for ER and PgR status using ligand-binding assays and had had their DNA ploidy and S-phase fractions measured by flow cytometry. Telomerase activity had already been determined by using a modified telomeric repeat and amplification protocol (TRAP) assay.\nRESULTS: The expression of hTERT mRNA in the breast tumours ranged between 1.3 and 2.7 x 10(7) copy numbers per micro g of cellular RNA (the median value was 2.7x10(5) and the mean was 3.1 x 10(6)). Telomerase activity was between 0 and 246 units of Total Protein Generated (TPG), where one unit of TPG was equal to 600 molecules, of telomerase substrate primers extended by at least three telomeric repeats. The median level of TPG was 60 units and the mean level was 81 units). Telomerase activity was found to significantly correlate with hTERT expression (r(s)=0.51112, P=0.0302). There was no significant correlation between hTERT and other parameters.\nQuestion: Does hTERT mRNA expression correlate with telomerase activity in human breast cancer?"}], "answer": "[True]. hTERT mRNA expression significantly correlates with telomerase activity in human breast cancer.

This study is aimed at exploring the therapeutic effects of long-term treatment with two different beneficial bacterial strains (Bifidobacterium breve M-16\u2009V and Lactobacillus rhamnosus NutRes1) and a glucocorticoid (budesonide), as a reference treatment, on inflammatory response in a murine model for chronic allergic asthma.\nMETHODS: To mimic the chronic disease in asthmatic patients, we used the murine ovalbumin-induced asthma model combined with prolonged allergen exposure. Airway function; pulmonary airway inflammation; airway remodelling, mRNA expression of pattern recognition receptors, Th-specific cytokines and transcription factors in lung tissue; mast cell degranulation; in vitro T cell activation; and expression of Foxp3 in blood Th cells were examined.\nRESULTS: Lactobacillus rhamnosus reduced lung resistance to a similar extent as budesonide treatment in chronically asthmatic mice. Pulmonary airway inflammation, mast cell degranulation, T cell activation and airway remodelling were suppressed by all treatments. Beneficial bacteria and budesonide differentially modulated the expression of toll-like receptors (TLRs), nod-like receptors (NLRs), cytokines and T cell transcription factors. Bifidobacterium breve induced regulatory T cell responses in the airways by increasing Il10 and Foxp3 transcription in lung tissue as well as systemic by augmenting the mean fluorescence intensity of Foxp3 in blood CD4+ T cells.\nQuestion: Is bifidobacterium breve and Lactobacillus rhamnosus treatment as effective as budesonide at reducing inflammation in a murine model for chronic asthma?"}], "answer": "[True].

Such information may help to identify patients who would likely benefit from adjuvant radiotherapy rather than active surveillance. A multiplex proteomic assay, previously tested on biopsies and found to be predictive of favorable or unfavorable pathology at radical prostatectomy, was assessed for its predictive value to identify patients at higher risk of biochemical relapse.\nMETHODS: Proteomic assays from core needle biopsies from 288 men who subsequently underwent radical prostatectomy at the Centre hospitalier de l'Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al were evaluated for prediction of subsequent biochemical recurrence.\nRESULTS: Of the 288 men, biochemical relapse was observed in 47 (16.3%) and metastases in 5 (1.7%). Median follow up was 68.5 months. The proteomic assay clearly separated patients into three categories - low, intermediate and high risk of biochemical relapse (p=0.0007). Assay scores predicted biochemical relapse in univariate analysis (hazard ratio: 1.724, p=0.0002 per 20% change in score), significantly better than other pre-operative prognostic parameters. Additionally, the assay score had a significantly higher p-value when combined with clinical NCCN stage compared to stage alone (hazard ratio: 1.579, p=0.0017 per 20% change in score).\nQuestion: Does biopsy-based Proteomic Assay predict Risk of Biochemical Recurrence after Radical Prostatectomy?"}], "answer": "[True].

Nevertheless, when glycerol was used as carbon source instead of glucose, the uptake rate as well as the biomass production and the lipid accumulation processes were unaffected by the TWH organic nitrogen removal. Finally, when the fungus was grown on a glucose supplemented TWH medium that contained no assimilable organic nitrogen (after further precipitation of proteins with methanol), the produced biomass contained non-negligible quantities of lipids, although glucose uptake remained low. Lipid analysis showed that the produced lipids comprised mainly of neutral lipids, which were preferentially consumed during lipid turnover. Lipid production on the original TWH medium having glucose as carbon source was 0.48 g of lipid per gram of dry biomass, corresponding to 8.7 g of lipid per litre of growth medium.

The frequency of BTSS associated with IIHWOP in patients with migraine is unknown.\nOBJECTIVE: To detect the frequency of BTSS in adult patients with migraine and to investigate whether the presence of BTSS identifies patients with IIHWOP.\nMETHODS: In a prospective study from December 2000 to November 2005, 724 consecutive patients with recurrent headaches who fulfilled International Headache Society diagnostic criteria for migraine underwent cerebral MR venography (MRV). A portion of these patients underwent a lumbar puncture (LP) to measure CSF pressure. MRV and LP were also performed in 70 age-matched control subjects.\nRESULTS: Six hundred seventy-five of the 724 patients with migraines had normal MRV. Seventy of these 675 patients underwent LP, and all of them had normal CSF pressure. Forty-nine (6.7%) of the 724 patients with migraine had BTSS. Twenty-eight of these 49 patients with BTSS underwent LP, and 19 (67.8%) had IIHWOP. The headache profiles of patients with BTSS and IIHWOP did not differ from those of patients with normal MRVs and CSF pressures within normal limits. CSF pressure was normal in both patients and controls with normal MRV.\nQuestion: Does bilateral transverse sinus stenosis predict IIH without papilledema in patients with migraine?"}], "answer": "[True]. Of patients with migraine, 6.7% had bilateral transverse sinus stenosis; 67.8% of these patients had idiopathic intracranial hypertension without papilledema (IIHWOP). These results suggest that patients with migraine who present bilateral transverse sinus stenosis on cerebral MR venography should undergo lumbar puncture to exclude IIHWOP."}

Caspase-3/CPP32 activity and activation was measured by ELISA and Western blotting, respectively. Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was applied to examine the expression of LPA-receptor transcripts. Mice were treated with 250 microL of 1 mmol/L LPA and exposed to whole-body gamma-irradiation with a dose of 12 or 15 Gy and the number and localization of apoptotic bodies along the crypt were recorded.\nRESULTS: LPA pretreatment reduced DNA fragmentation induced in all models of apoptosis. LPA rescued cells from apoptosis when applied up to 1 hour after camptothecin treatment or 2 hours after irradiation. LPA inhibited the activation of caspase-3/CPP32 and attenuated its activity. Blocking LPA1 receptors by pertussis toxin and the inhibition of epithelial growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase significantly attenuated the protective effect. In irradiated mice, oral LPA significantly reduced the number of apoptotic bodies in the crypt.\nQuestion: Does lysophosphatidic acid protect and rescues intestinal epithelial cells from radiation- and chemotherapy-induced apoptosis?"}], "answer": "[True]. (1) LPA prevents and rescues IEC-6 from apoptosis elicited by 4 different mechanisms.

However, it remains unclear whether such an effect can be elicited at later embryonic or postnatal stages, which has important implications in mouse HC regeneration by reactivation of Notch1 signaling.\nRESULTS: We performed comprehensive in vivo inducible overactivation of NICD at various developmental stages. In CAG(CreER+); Rosa26-NICD(loxp/+) mice, tamoxifen treatment at embryonic day 10.5 (E10.5) generated ectopic HCs in the non-sensory regions in both utricle and cochlea, whereas ectopic HCs only appeared in the utricle when tamoxifen was given at E13. When tamoxifen was injected at postnatal day 0 (P0) and P1, no ectopic HCs were observed in either utricle or cochlea. Interestingly, Notch1 signaling induced new HCs in a non-cell-autonomous manner, because the new HCs did not express NICD.

Our data demonstrate that the developmental stage determines responsiveness of embryonic otic precursors and neonatal non-sensory epithelial cells to NICD overactivation, and that Notch 1 signaling in the wild type, postnatal inner ear is not sufficient for generating new HCs. Thus, our genetic mouse model is suitable to test additional pathways that could synergistically interact with Notch1 pathway to produce HCs at postnatal ages."}

Loading of cohesin onto chromosomes is dependent on another protein complex called kollerin, containing Nipbl/Scc2 and Mau2/Scc4. Nipbl is an evolutionarily conserved large protein whose haploinsufficiency in humans causes a developmental disorder called Cornelia de Lange syndrome. Although the function of Nipbl homologues for chromosome cohesion in meiotic cells of non-vertebrate models has been elucidated, Nipbl has not been characterized so far in mammalian spermatocytes or oocytes.\nRESULTS: Here we describe our analyses on the expression and localization of Nipbl in nuclei of mouse spermatocytes and oocytes at different stages of meiotic prophase. In both spermatocytes and oocytes we found that Nipbl is associated with the axial/lateral element of the synaptonemal complex (AE/LE) to which cohesin also localizes. Interestingly, Nipbl in spermatocytes, but not in oocytes, dissociates from the AE/LE at mid-pachytene stage coincident with completion of DNA double-strand break repair.\nQuestion: Does cohesin loading factor Nipbl localize to chromosome axes during mammalian meiotic prophase?"}], "answer": "[True].

Single-voxel MR spectroscopy was then performed utilizing a point-resolved spectroscopy sequence protocol with a short echo time (30 msec).\nRESULTS: MR imaging revealed a focal ring-enhancing mass in one patient, multiple ring-enhancing lesions in the second patient, a large area of edema and mass effect without associated enhancement in the third patient, and multiple solid and peripherally enhancing lesions in the fourth patient. MR spectroscopic results in all 4 patients demonstrated marked elevation of the glutamate and glutamine peaks (2.1-2.5 ppm). Other nonspecific (and in a sense confounding) findings included elevation of the choline peak (3.2 ppm), elevation of the lactate peak (1.3 ppm), elevation of the lipid peak (0.5-1.5 ppm), and decrease in the N-acetylaspartate peak (2.0 ppm).

Furthermore, ROS scavengers were shown to ablate the effect of puro vectors on protein aggregation in transfected cells demonstrating a dependency of this effect on the redox state of transfected cells.\nQuestion: Do puromycin-based vectors promote a ROS-dependent recruitment of PML to nuclear inclusions enriched with HSP70 and Proteasomes?"}], "answer": "[True]. Taken together we propose that puromycin vectors may elicit an unexpected misfolded protein response, associated with the formation of nuclear aggresome like structures in human cell lines. This effect has broad implications for cellular behavior and experimental design."}

In this study, we examine patterns of species distributions and phylogenetic diversity in Asia and investigate if the observed diversity patterns are associated with differences in diversification rates between the tropical and non-tropical regions. We used species distribution maps and phylogenetic trees to generate species and phylogenetic diversity measures for 1\u00b0 \u00d7 1\u00b0 cells across mainland Asia. We constructed lineage-through-time plots and estimated diversification shift-times to examine the temporal patterns of diversifications across orders. Finally, we tested if the observed gradients in Asia could be associated with geographical differences in diversification rates across the tropical and non-tropical biomes. We estimated speciation, extinction and dispersal rates across these two regions for mammals, both globally and for Asian mammals.\nRESULTS: Our results demonstrate strong latitudinal and longitudinal gradients of species and phylogenetic diversity with Southeast Asia and the Himalayas showing highest diversity. Importantly, our results demonstrate that differences in diversification (speciation, extinction and dispersal) rates between the tropical and the non-tropical biomes influence the observed diversity gradients globally and in Asia. For the first time, we demonstrate that Asian tropics act as both cradles and museums of mammalian diversity.\nQuestion: Do higher speciation and lower extinction rates influence mammal diversity gradients in Asia?"}], "answer": "[True]. Temporal and spatial variation in diversification rates across different lineages of mammals is an important correlate of species diversity gradients observed in Asia."}

The most common indication for transplantation was biliary atresia. Seven patients required reoperation for intestinal obstruction. All 7 patients had abdominal operations before transplantation and 5 of 7 received reduced-size grafts. No patients had adhesive small bowel obstruction. The cause was right-sided diaphragmatic hernia in 4 and post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) in 3. Diaphragmatic hernia was demonstrated by chest radiograph in 3 of 4 patients. The fourth was taken to surgery with a presumptive diagnosis of intestinal obstruction and a diaphragmatic hernia was found at exploration. In patients with PTLD causing obstruction, 2 presented with an obstructing mass and the third presented with intussusception. Mean time to reoperation was 29 months after liver transplantation.

Median adherence levels were 100% by three-day recall, 97.4% by 30-day visual analog scale, 97.3% by unannounced pill count/liquid formulation weights, and 96.3% by medication event monitors (MEMS). Interruptions in MEMS adherence of \u2265 48 hours were seen in 57.0% of children; 36.3% had detectable HIV RNA at one year. Only MEMS correlated significantly with HIV RNA levels (r = -0.25, p = 0.04).

Subsequently, realtime-PCR was carried out to quantify the mRNAs encoding Wnt-1, Dickkopf-1 (DKK-1), receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL), osteoprotegelin (OPG) and TNF (tumor necrosis factor)-alpha. In histomorphometric analysis, the infiltrating pannus volume and pannus surface, and the following items in contact with pannus surface were measured: osteoclast number, osteoid surface, osteoid volume and labeling surface. These were evaluated in the distal femur with CIA with or without ETN administration.\nRESULTS: TNF-alpha, RANKL and OPG mRNA expressions, linked to osteoclastogenesis, were not significantly different with or without ETN administration. ETN administration significantly increased Wnt-1 mRNA expression, the osteoblast promoter, and decreased DKK-1 mRNA expression, the Wnt signal inhibitor. In histomorphometric analysis, pannus volume, pannus surface and osteoclast number, parameters of bone destruction, were not significantly different among groups.

Our results suggest that ETN suppresses DDK-1 expression, and, as a result, Wnt expression is promoted and osteoblastogenesis becomes more active, independent of the regulation of osteoclast activity. Marked bone formation is attributed to the fact that ETN directly promotes osteoblastogenesis, not as a result of suppressing osteoclastogenesis."}

Till now, accumulating evidence has proposed the pivotal role of toll-like receptors (TLRs) in renal inflammation in diabetic patients.

Moreover, deletion of TLR2 inhibited the HG-induced activation of MyD88-dependent pathway, but not TIR domain containing adapter inducing interferon-\u03b2 (Trif) signal pathway in BMDMs. As HG stimulation polarizes macrophages into M1 phenotype, treatment of PF or knockout of TLR2 significantly reduces M1 markers on the membrane of macrophages.

Circumferential left ventricular (LV) mid-wall myocardial strain (E(cc)) was estimated in vivo using tagged magnetic resonance imaging. Myocardial water content (MWC) was measured post mortem, from which interfilament lattice distance (d) was calculated. In 6 pigs (group 2), myocardial dysfunction was produced by intracoronary administration of a mast cell degranulator.

Studies on adaptation to heat shock have shown the involvement of the chaperon system-proteins in various gram-positive bacteria. The corresponding operons, namely the dnaK and groESL operons, are controlled by a negative mechanism involving the HrcA repressor protein binding to the cis acting element CIRCE.\nRESULTS: We studied adaptation to heat shock in the lactic acid bacterium Lactobacillus plantarum. The LM3-2 strain, carrying a null mutation in the ccpA gene, encoding the catabolite control protein A (CcpA), showed a lower percent of survival to high temperature with respect to the LM3 wild type strain. Among proteins differentially expressed in the two strains, the GroES chaperon was more abundant in the wild type strain compared to the mutant strain under standard growth conditions. Transcriptional studies showed that class I heat shock operons were differentially expressed upon heat shock in both strains. Indeed, the dnaK and groESL operons were induced about two times more in the LM3 strain compared to the LM3-2 strain. Analysis of the regulatory region of the two operons showed the presence of cre sequences, putative binding sites for the CcpA protein.\nQuestion: Does ccpA affect expression of the groESL and dnaK operons in Lactobacillus plantarum?"}], "answer": "[True]. The L. plantarum dnaK and groESL operons are characterized by the presence of the cis acting sequence CIRCE in the promoter region, suggesting a negative regulation by the HrcA/CIRCE system, which is a common type of control among the class I heat shock operons of gram-positive bacteria. We found an additional system of regulation, based on a positive control exerted by the CcpA protein, which would interact with cre sequences present in the regulatory region of the dnaK and groESL operons. The absence of the CcpA protein results in a lower induction of the chaperon coding operons, with a consequent lower percent of survival of the LM3-2 mutant strain population with respect to the wild type when challenged with a heat insult."}

Dps (DNA-binding protein in starved cells) mutants of E. coli have reduced acid tolerance when compared to the parent strain although the role of Dps in acid tolerance is unclear. This study investigated the mechanism by which Dps contributes to acid tolerance in E. coli O157:H7.\nRESULTS: The results from this study showed that acid stress lead to damage of chromosomal DNA, which was accentuated in dps and recA mutants. The use of Bal31, which cleaves DNA at nicks and single-stranded regions, to analyze chromosomal DNA extracted from cells challenged at pH 2.0 provided in vivo evidence of acid damage to DNA. The DNA damage in a recA mutant further corroborated the hypothesis that acid stress leads to DNA strand breaks. Under in vitro assay conditions, Dps was shown to bind plasmid DNA directly and protect it from acid-induced strand breaks. Furthermore, the extraction of DNA from Dps-DNA complexes required a denaturing agent at low pH (2.2 and 3.6) but not at higher pH (>pH4.6). Low pH also restored the DNA-binding activity of heat-denatured Dps. Circular dichroism spectra revealed that at pH 3.6 and pH 2.2 Dps maintains or forms alpha-helices that are important for Dps-DNA complex formation.\nQuestion: Is acid stress damage of DNA prevented by Dps binding in Escherichia coli O157 : H7?"}], "answer": "[True]. Results from the present work showed that acid stress results in DNA damage that is more pronounced in dps and recA mutants. The contribution of RecA to acid tolerance indicated that DNA repair was important even when Dps was present. Dps protected DNA from acid damage by binding to DNA. Low pH appeared to strengthen the Dps-DNA association and the secondary structure of Dps retained or formed alpha-helices at low pH. Further investigation into the precise interplay between DNA protection and damage repair pathways during acid stress are underway to gain additional insight."}

We also evaluate the over-expressed miR-26a in TPC-1 cells in severe combined immune-deficient mice. We used luciferase reporter assays, real-time PCR and western blot analysis to measure the expression and activity of miR-26a, CKS2, and related factors such as cyclin B1, cyclin A, cdk1, bcl-xl and Akt. Finally, we measured the relationship between the levels of miR-26a and CKS2 in PTC and normal thyroid tissues.\nRESULTS: Relative to normal thyroid tissues, miR-26a is consistently down-regulated in TPC specimens, and CKS2 was identified as a potential target. Up-regulated miR-26a expression or down-regulated CKS2 expression in TPC-1 and CGTH W3 cells lines caused G2 phase-arrest.

Secondary brain injury often occurs in the days following the initial hemorrhage and is associated with significant neurological deterioration. The neurochemistry associated with secondary injury is poorly understood. The purpose of this study is to characterize the neurochemical changes in perihematomal tissue during frameless minimally invasive evacuation of spontaneous hematomas.\nMETHODS: This is a nonrandomized prospective microdialysis study of 12 consecutive patients undergoing Frameless Stereotactic Aspiration and Thrombolysis (FAST) of deep ICHs. Hourly glucose, lactate, pyruvate, and glutamate were measured in the perihematomal tissue of patients undergoing minimally invasive hematoma evacuation. Analyte concentrations were compared to evaluate the natural history of perihematomal neurochemistry and to identify changes potentially related to secondary injury.\nRESULTS: Brain hematoma volumes were reduced 87% during FAST and National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores were improved from an average of 19 at admission to 12.6 at time of discharge from the intensive care unit. Glutamate average values decreased from the first 24 hours of measurement (12 mmol/L +/- 6) to the final 24-hour epoch (5 mmol/L +/- 6). Glutamate reduction showed a significant linear (p = 0.0007) and quadratic (p <0.05) trend during hematoma drainage.

In multivariate analysis, the sexual risk differential for travelers is explained by occupational exposure and higher socio-economic status. The differential in condom acceptance, by contrast, appears to be associated with travel itself. Condom use with non-spousal partners is three times higher among travelers than non-travelers (P< 0.001), and travel remains a significant predictor after controlling for age, education, residence, occupation and multiple partners.

Minocycline, a tetracycline, has been shown to exhibit beneficial effects in this malignancy through regulation of a cohort of genes that overlap significantly with the NF-\u03baB transcriptome. Here, it was examined whether or not the molecular mechanism could be attributed to modulation of NF-\u03baB signaling using a combination of in vitro and in vivo models. Minocycline suppressed constitutive NF-\u03baB activation in OVCAR-3 and SKOV-3 ovarian carcinoma cells and was correlated with attenuation of I\u03baB\u03b1 kinase (IKK) activation, I\u03baB\u03b1 phosphorylation and degradation, and p65 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation. The inhibition of IKK was found to be associated with suppression of TGF-\u03b2-activated-kinase-1 (TAK1) activation and its dissociation from TAK1-binding-protein-1 (TAB1), an indispensable functional mediator between TGF-\u03b2 and TAK1. Further studies demonstrated that minocycline downregulated TGF-\u03b21 expression. Enforced TGF-\u03b21 expression induced NF-\u03baB activity, and minocycline rescued this effect. Consistent with this finding, TGF-\u03b21 knockdown suppressed NF-\u03baB activation and abrogated the inhibitory effect of minocycline on this transcription factor.

Furthermore, the influence of minocycline on NF-\u03baB pathway activation was examined in female nude mice harboring intraperitoneal OVCAR-3 tumors. Both acute and chronic administration of minocycline led to suppression of p65 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation accompanied by downregulation of NF-\u03baB activity and endogenous protein levels of its target gene products.

Its concentration in the circulation increases during fasting and decreases upon re-feeding. This has fostered the notion that the absence of food in the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract stimulates the secretion of ghrelin. The purpose of the present study was to determine the concentration of ghrelin in serum and oxyntic mucosa after replacing food with intravenous (iv) infusion of nutrients for 8 days using the technique known as total parenteral nutrition (TPN) MATERIALS AND METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats (200-250 g) were given nutrients (lipids, glucose, amino acids, minerals and vitamins) by iv infusion for 8 days during which time they were deprived of food and water; another group was deprived of food for 24-48 h (fasted controls), while fed controls had free access to food and water. Serum ghrelin, gastrin and pancreastatin concentrations were measured together with the ghrelin content of the oxyntic mucosa. Plasma insulin and glucose as well as serum lipid concentrations were also determined.\nRESULTS: Fasted rats had higher serum ghrelin than TPN rats and fed controls. The oxyntic mucosal ghrelin concentration (and content) was lower in TPN rats than in fasted rats or fed controls. The serum gastrin and pancreastatin concentrations were lower in TPN rats and fasted rats than in fed controls. The plasma insulin concentration was 87 pmol/l+/-8 (SEM) in TPN rats compared to 101+/-16 pmol/l in fed controls; it was 26+/-14 pmol/l in fasted rats. The basal plasma glucose level was 11+/-0.6 mmol/l in TPN rats and 12+/-0.8 mmol/l in fed controls; it was 7+/-0.3 mmol/l in fasted rats. In TPN rats, the serum concentrations of free fatty acids, triglycerides and cholesterol were increased by 100%, 50% and 25%, respectively, compared to fed controls. Fasted rats had higher circulating concentrations of free fatty acids (20%) and lower concentrations of triglycerides (-40%) than fed controls; fasted rats did not differ from fed controls with respect to serum cholesterol.\nQuestion: Does long-term infusion of nutrients ( total parenteral nutrition ) suppress circulating ghrelin in food-deprived rats?"}], "answer": "[True]. The circulating ghrelin concentration is high in situations of nutritional deficiency (starvation) and low in situations of nutritional plenty (free access to food or TPN). The actual presence or absence of food in the GI tract seems irrelevant. Circulating insulin and glucose concentrations did not differ much between TPN rats and fed controls; serum lipids, however, were elevated in the TPN rats. We suggest that elevated blood lipid levels contribute to the suppression of circulating ghrelin in rats subjected to TPN for 8 days."}

However, little is known about the underlying regulatory mechanism of the changes of HIF-1\u03b1 caused by microtubule network alternation. The von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein (pVHL), as a ubiquitin ligase, is best understood as a negative regulator of HIF-1\u03b1.\nRESULTS: In primary rat cardiomyocytes and H9c2 cardiac cells, microtubule-stabilization was achieved by pretreating with paclitaxel or transfection of microtubule-associated protein 4 (MAP4) overexpression plasmids and microtubule-depolymerization was achieved by pretreating with colchicine or transfection of MAP4 siRNA before hypoxia treatment. Recombinant adenovirus vectors for overexpressing pVHL or silencing of pVHL expression were constructed and transfected in primary rat cardiomyocytes and H9c2 cells. With different microtubule-stabilizing and -depolymerizing treaments, we demonstrated that the protein levels of HIF-1\u03b1 were down-regulated through overexpression of pVHL and were up-regulated through knockdown of pVHL in hypoxic cardiomyocytes. Importantly, microtubular structure breakdown activated p38/MAPK pathway, accompanied with the upregulation of pVHL. In coincidence, we found that SB203580, a p38/MAPK inhibitor decreased pVHL while MKK6 (Glu) overexpression increased pVHL in the microtubule network altered-hypoxic cardiomyocytes and H9c2 cells.\nQuestion: Does microtubular stability affect pVHL-mediated regulation of HIF-1alpha via the p38/MAPK pathway in hypoxic cardiomyocytes?"}], "answer": "[True].

The choriodecidua produces relaxin (RLN) and elevated levels are associated with preterm premature rupture of the fetal membranes. However, it is not increased in bacterially-mediated PTB, but may act as an endogenous sterile inflammatory mediator. Elevated systemic RLN levels from the corpus luteum are also associated with PTB, but the mechanism is unknown. In clinical obstetrics, intrauterine inflammation or infection can coexist with elevated RLN. Therefore, in this study, we further characterized the effects of RLN alone or together with an inflammatory mediator on the production of IL1B, CSF2 (GM-CSF), IL6, IL8 and TNF, from chorionic cytotrophoblasts (CyT), decidual fibroblasts (DF) and stromal cells (DSC), using interleukin-1 beta (IL1B) to mimic sterile inflammation or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for bacterial infection. Endogenous differences between the cells showed that the CyT expressed more RLN, its receptor RXFP1 and the RXFP1 splice variant D. CyT also showed the most robust cAMP response to RLN with increased IL6 secreted after 4\u00a0h, preceded by increased transcription at 1\u00a0h, likely due to activation of RXFP1 and cAMP. When all cell types were treated with IL1B and RLN, RLN augmented secretion of IL6 and IL8 from CyT and DF, but not DSC. Similarly, RLN augmented LPS-induced IL6 secretion from CyT and DF. Despite the structural similarity between TLR4 and RXFP1, blocking TLR4 in CyT had no effect on RLN-induced IL6 secretion, suggesting specific activation of RXFP1. Thus, we have shown that in the presence of a low level of intrauterine inflammation/infection, elevated RLN could act on the CyT and DF to augment the inflammatory response, contributing to the pathophysiology of PTB.\nQuestion: Does relaxin augment the inflammatory IL6 response in the choriodecidua?"}], "answer": "[True].

Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify predictors of obstructive CAD. A total of 7530 consecutive patients were included. At catheterization, 3819 (50.7%) were diagnosed as having obstructive CAD. Patients with a positive result on MPS (performed in 23.5% of patients) were significantly more likely to have obstructive CAD as assessed by ICA than those who did not undergo non-invasive testing (74.4 vs. 45.6%, P < 0.001).

However, it remains unknown whether the relationship between elevated FPG and increased risks of MetS exists in older women with normoglycemia (FPG<100mg/dL). Therefore, the present study was conducted to fill the lack of information in that area.\nMETHODS: We included 6505 apparently healthy women, aged 65years and older, with normoglycemia who participated in routine health checkups at health screening centers in Taiwan. Components of MetS (FPG, waist circumference (WC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), triglycerides, and systolic/diastolic blood pressure), body mass index (BMI), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), total cholesterol, and percentage body fat (PBF) were examined in all subjects.\nRESULTS: Subjects were sub-grouped by FPG levels (<90mg/dL, 91-95mg/dL and >95mg/dL for group 1, group 2 and group 3, respectively). Subjects in group 2 and group 3 were 1.22-fold (P=0.017) and 1.25-fold (P=0.007) more likely to have MetS compared with those in group 1. Age, WC, BMI, PBF, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, triglycerides, and HDL-C were significantly correlated with FPG, whereas HDL-C was negatively correlated with FPG. In a multivariate stepwise regression analysis, PBF, LDL-C, triglycerides, and age were significantly and independently associated with FPG.\nQuestion: Are elevated fasting glucose levels within normal range associated with an increased risk of metabolic syndrome in older women?"}], "answer": "[True]. Among older women, the risk of MetS was significantly associated with elevated FPG even for subjects with normal FPG. Lifestyle interventions for reducing PBF and controlling dyslipidemia could help reduce the risk of MetS in this population."}

The relevant intracellular apoptotic pathways, however, are unknown. XIAP is an antiapoptotic protein that both inhibits caspases and reciprocally regulates the proapoptotic Smac/Omi proteins. AAV-mediated delivery of various XIAP mutants could distinguish between these antiapoptotic pathways in the ear and further the development of specific reagents for gene therapy- mediated prevention of cisplatin-induced ototoxicity.\nMETHODS: We administered unilaterally through the round-window AAV-harboring genes encoding wild-type dXIAP, yellow fluorescent protein, or either of two dXIAP point mutants-one deficient in caspase inhibition (dXIAP-d) and the other additionally deficient in the binding of Smac/Omi (dXIAP-t). All rats received a 3-day systemic course of cisplatin. Functional hearing loss was measured by shifts in auditory brainstem response (ABR) thresholds after cisplatin treatment, and hair-cell loss was assessed by whole-mount phalloidin staining of cochlear turns.\nRESULTS: Uninjected ears universally displayed high-frequency-specific hair-cell loss and ABR threshold shifts upon cisplatin treatment. Although yellow fluorescent protein had no effect, ears injected with dXIAP exhibited 68% less ABR threshold shift at 32 kHz and 50% less basal-turn outer-hair-cell loss compared with contralateral untreated ears. This protection was maintained in ears injected with dXIAP-d but was abolished in those expressing dXIAP-t, which is incapable of blocking Smac/Omi.\nQuestion: Is protection against cisplatin-induced ototoxicity by adeno-associated virus-mediated delivery of the X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein dependent on caspase inhibition?"}], "answer": "[False].

In our present study, we examined the expression of thiamine biosynthetic genes, of genes encoding thiamine diphosphate-dependent enzymes and the levels of thiamine compounds during the early (sensing) and late (adaptation) responses of Arabidopsis seedlings to oxidative, salinity and osmotic stress. The possible roles of plant hormones in the regulation of the thiamine contribution to stress responses were also explored.\nRESULTS: The expression of Arabidopsis genes involved in the thiamine diphosphate biosynthesis pathway, including that of THI1, THIC, TH1 and TPK, was analyzed for 48 h in seedlings subjected to NaCl or sorbitol treatment. These genes were found to be predominantly up-regulated in the early phase (2-6 h) of the stress response. The changes in these gene transcript levels were further found to correlate with increases in thiamine and its diphosphate ester content in seedlings, as well as with the enhancement of gene expression for enzymes which require thiamine diphosphate as a cofactor, mainly \u03b1-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, pyruvate dehydrogenase and transketolase. In the case of the phytohormones including the salicylic, jasmonic and abscisic acids which are known to be involved in plant stress responses, only abscisic acid was found to significantly influence the expression of thiamine biosynthetic genes, the thiamine diphosphate levels, as well as the expression of genes coding for main thiamine diphosphate-dependent enzymes. Using Arabidopsis mutant plants defective in abscisic acid production, we demonstrate that this phytohormone is important in the regulation of THI1 and THIC gene expression during salt stress but that the regulatory mechanisms underlying the osmotic stress response are more complex.\nQuestion: Is the upregulation of thiamine ( vitamin B1 ) biosynthesis in Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings under salt and osmotic stress conditions mediated by abscisic acid at the early stages of this stress response?"}], "answer": "[True].

Proviral clones of HTLV-1 with pX ORF-II mutations diminish the ability of the virus to maintain viral loads in vivo. p30 expressed exogenously differentially modulates CREB and Tax-responsive element-mediated transcription through its interaction with CREB-binding protein/p300 and while acting as a repressor of many genes including Tax, in part by blocking tax/rex RNA nuclear export, selectively enhances key gene pathways involved in T-cell signaling/activation.\nRESULTS: Herein, we analyzed the role of p30 in cell cycle regulation. Jurkat T-cells transduced with a p30 expressing lentivirus vector accumulated in the G2-M phase of cell cycle. We then analyzed key proteins involved in G2-M checkpoint activation. p30 expression in Jurkat T-cells resulted in an increase in phosphorylation at serine 216 of nuclear cell division cycle 25C (Cdc25C), had enhanced checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1) serine 345 phosphorylation, reduced expression of polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1), diminished phosphorylation of PLK1 at tyrosine 210 and reduced phosphorylation of Cdc25C at serine 198. Finally, primary human lymphocyte derived cell lines immortalized by a HTLV-1 proviral clone defective in p30 expression were more susceptible to camptothecin induced apoptosis.

The frequency of CD4(+)FOXP3(+) cells and Foxp3 mRNA levels in the spleen of male NOD recipients were also quantified. In vivo cell homing was assessed by monitoring 5,6-carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE)-labelled T cells or MSCs. In vitro, cell proliferation and cytokine production were assessed by adding graded doses of irradiated MSCs to insulin B9-23 peptide-specific T cell lines in the presence of irradiated splenocytes pulsed with the peptide.\nRESULTS: MSCs reduced the capacity of diabetogenic T cells to infiltrate pancreatic islets and to transfer diabetes. This protective effect was not associated with the modification of diabetogenic T cell homing, but correlated with a preferential migration of MSCs to pancreatic lymph nodes. While injection of diabetogenic T cells resulted in a decrease in levels of FOXP3(+) regulatory T cells, this decrease was inhibited by MSC co-transfer. Moreover, MSCs were able to suppress both allogeneic and insulin-specific proliferative responses in vitro.

In the last decade it was suggested that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and in particular inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 are associated with an increase in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Aspirin is known to reduce the incidence and mortality from ischemic heart disease and is a mainstay in the prevention of vascular complications of atherosclerosis.\nOBJECTIVE: To examine the effect of meloxicam, a selective COX-2 inhibitor, or low dose aspirin on the development of experimental atherosclerosis in apoE knockout (KO) compared to wild-type (WT) mice. We aimed to test the hypothesis that meloxicam, a potential vasculitis inducer, would exacerbate atherosclerotic lesions while aspirin, which is known to reduce the incidence of thrombosis occlusive events, would increase protection in this model.\nMETHODS: We randomly divided 36 male apoE KO and 36 WT mice, 8 weeks old. Mice were treated for 10 weeks with 0.1 mg/ml aspirin, or 0.05 mg/ml meloxicam, dissolved in their drinking water. Control groups received regular drinking water.

This study was conducted to analyze in detail the T cell immune response against p205 and to investigate whether immunity to p205 may play a role in T cell-mediated immunopathology in active RA.\nMETHODS: Cibachron blue, protein A-Sepharose, and gel filtration on Sephacryl were used successively to enrich p205 from synovial fluid (SF). T lymphocytes from RA patients were isolated from the peripheral blood (PB), lymph nodes, and SF, and p205 and peptides derived from known sequences were assessed by T cell proliferation assays in the presence of IL-2.\nRESULTS: P205-specific proliferation of T cells was observed in PB as well as in SF. When p205 was isolated from RA SF, proliferation of RA T cells peaked on day 3. With p205 purified from SF from trauma patients, there was a significant shift of the maximum T cell proliferation to day 8. T cells were of CD4 or CD8 phenotype, and B cells did not proliferate to a significant degree. The T cell response to p205 was always higher for SF mononuclear cells (SFMC) compared with PBMC (P < 0.001). In 1 RA patient who underwent repeated leukapheresis, this led to a reproducible decline in p205-specific T cell proliferation to control levels. PB T cells specifically proliferating in response to p205 were detected in 20 of 32 RA patients (63%). Of 26 patients with other inflammatory rheumatic diseases, only 1 showed a minor response to p205, while normal donors did not demonstrate a significant T cell proliferation. A synthetic p205-derived peptide, with an amino acid sequence identical to an immunoglobulin sequence located in the area where RF binds, was reactive with T cells from RA patients.\nQuestion: Is p205 a major target of autoreactive T cells in rheumatoid arthritis?"}], "answer": "[True]. P205 appears to be a major target of autoreactive T cells in RA. P205-specific T cells are primed and more abundant at the site of inflammation. As a T cell target in RA, p205 may well be an antigen involved in the initiation of RF production."}

Although soluble CD4 (sCD4) can inactivate laboratory-adapted HIV-1 strains, it fails to reduce the viral loads in clinical trials because of its low potency against primary isolates and tendency to enhance HIV-1 infection at low concentration. Thus, it is essential to design a better HIV inactivator with improved potency for developing new anti-HIV therapeutics that can actively attack the virus in the circulation before it attaches to and enter into the target cell.\nRESULTS: We engineered a bivalent HIV-1 inactivator, designated 2DLT, by linking the D1D2 domain of CD4 to T1144, the next generation HIV fusion inhibitor, with a 35-mer linker. The D1D2 domain in this soluble 2DLT protein could bind to the CD4-binding site and induce the formation of the gp41 prehairpin fusion-intermediate (PFI), but showed no sCD4-mediated enhancement of HIV-1 infection. The T1144 domain in 2DLT then bound to the exposed PFI, resulting in rapid inactivation of HIV-1 virions in the absence of the target cell. Beside, 2DLT could also inhibit fusion of the virus with the target cell if the virion escapes the first attack of 2DLT.\nQuestion: Does a bivalent recombinant protein inactivate HIV-1 by targeting the gp41 prehairpin fusion intermediate induced by CD4 D1D2 domains?"}], "answer": "[True]. This bivalent molecule can serve as a dual barrier against HIV infection by first inactivating HIV-1 virions away from cells and then blocking HIV-1 entry on the target cell surface, indicating its potential for development as a new class of anti-HIV drug."}

Similar results were obtained by flow cytometry using activated platelets in suspension. C1q and C4d deposition on platelets was accompanied by an approximately 4-fold increase in fluid phase C4d and C3a generation. Consistent with activation of the classical complement pathway, C4 cleavage failed to occur in serum depleted of C1q but was unchanged in factor B deficient serum. C4 activation was enhanced by platelet stimulation using chemical (SFLLRN peptide) or mechanical (shear) means, and decreased following platelet exposure to plasmin. These treatments were accompanied by changes in platelet surface gC1qR/p33 expression, a cellular C1q binding protein.

To explain a largely lacking correlation between disease severity and QoL, we related genome wide gene expression to QoL. Patients with lower MCS scores had high expression levels of CXCL9 and CXCL11 cytokine-related genes (p=0.001; p=0.002); similarly, patients with low vitality scores had high expression levels of CXCL9, CXCL11 and IFNA6 cytokine-related genes (p=0.02; p=0.02; p=0.04), independent of patient characteristics. Subsequently, we associated cytokine related SNPs to mental QoL (MCS and vitality). SNP-cluster in the IL4R gene showed a weak association with MCS and vitality (strongest association p=0.0017). Although overall mental QoL was normal, >10% of patients had low scores for MCS and vitality. Post-hoc analysis of systemic inflammatory mediators showed that patients with lowest MCS and vitality scores had high levels of CCL11 cytokine (p=0.03; p=0.04).\nQuestion: Is mental quality of life related to a cytokine genetic pathway?"}], "answer": "[True]. Variation in the cytokine genetic pathway and its activation is related to mental QoL. These findings might allow us to identify and, ultimately, treat patients susceptible to poor QoL."}

We believe that they tend to be younger and have the added burden of the burn injury compared to other populations.

Data were collected all on adult burn patients who experienced in-hospital CA and CPR either in the BICU or associated burn operating room.

The study population included civilian burn patients from the local catchment area and burn casualties from the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, but patients with do-not-resuscitate (DNR) orders were excluded.\nRESULTS: We found 57 burn patients who had in-hospital CA and CPR yielding an incidence of one or more in-hospital CA of 34 per 1000 admissions (0.34%). Fourteen of these patients (25%) survived to discharge while 43 (75%) died. The most common initial cardiac rhythm was pulseless electrical activity (50.9%). The most common etiology of CA among burn patients was respiratory failure (49.1%). The most significant variable affecting survival to discharge was duration of CPR (P < 0.01) with no patient surviving more than 7 min of CPR.\nQuestion: Do outcomes after cardiac arrest in an adult burn center?"}], "answer": "[True]. CPR in burn patients is sometimes effective, and those patients who survive are likely to have good neurological outcomes. However, prolonged CPR times are unlikely to result in return of spontaneous circulation and may be considered futile.

The mRNA expression was analyzed by RT-PCR and/or Northern blot, and protein levels by Western blot and/or immunohistochemistry.\nRESULTS: Rats infused with Ang II for 3 days caused elevated renal expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha; gene and protein levels). TNF-alpha positive cells were observed in glomeruli (mainly in endothelial cells), tubules and vessels. In rats with immune complex nephritis, the renal overexpression of TNF-alpha was diminished by the ACE inhibitor quinapril. Systemic infusion of Ang II also increased renal synthesis of cytokines (interleukin-6, IL-6) and chemokines (monocyte chemoattractant protein-1; MCP-1) that were associated with elevated tissue levels of activated nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and the presence of inflammatory cell infiltration.\nQuestion: Does angiotensin II regulate the synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the kidney?"}], "answer": "[True]. Ang II in vivo increases TNF-alpha production in the kidney. Ang II also up-regulates other proinflammatory mediators, including IL-6, MCP-1 and NF-kappaB, coincidentally associated to the presence of glomerular and interstitial inflammatory cells in the kidney.

SCI was detected by MRI, and the patients were prospectively followed up. The end points of the study were the incidence of major events related to vascular events (cerebral events, cardiac events, and sudden deaths). We investigated the prognostic role of SCI in cerebral, cardiac, and vascular events by using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards analysis.\nRESULTS: The prevalence of SCI was 49.6% in HD patients.

In B. cinerea infected leaves, Pp\u03b1-DOX-GUS proteins accumulated in cells surrounding infected cells, suggesting a protective mechanism. Targeted disruption of Pp\u03b1-DOX did not cause a visible developmental alteration and did not compromise the defense response. However, overexpressing Pp\u03b1-DOX, or incubating wild-type tissues with Pp\u03b1-DOX-derived oxylipins, principally the aldehyde heptadecatrienal, resulted in smaller moss colonies with less protonemal tissues, due to a reduction of caulonemal filament growth and a reduction of chloronemal cell size compared with normal tissues. In addition, Pp\u03b1-DOX overexpression and treatments with Pp\u03b1-DOX-derived oxylipins reduced cellular damage caused by elicitors of P. carotovorum.\nQuestion: Does the Physcomitrella patens unique alpha-dioxygenase participate in both developmental processes and defense responses?"}], "answer": "[True]. Our study shows that the unique \u03b1-DOX of the primitive land plant P. patens, although apparently not crucial, participates both in development and in the defense response against pathogens, suggesting that \u03b1-DOXs from flowering plants could have originated by duplication and successive functional diversification after the divergence from bryophytes."}

In this study, we investigated the regulation of CNP secretion from monocytes and macrophages to estimate its contribution to the progression of inflammation.\nMETHODS: CNP secretion rates from two human leukemia cell lines (THP-1 and HL-60), human peripheral blood lymphocytes, granulocytes, monocytes, monocyte-derived macrophages, and mouse peritoneal macrophages were measured under conditions with or without stimulation. Immunoreactive CNP levels in the culture media of these cells were measured by a specific radioimmunoassay.\nRESULTS: The secretion rates of CNP from THP-1 and HL-60 cells were augmented according to the degree of their differentiation into macrophage-like cells under the stimulation with phorbol ester. Peripheral blood monocytes also increased the CNP secretion rate after their differentiation into macrophages. Retinoic acid elicited synergistic effects on the CNP secretion rate from HL-60 cells when administered with lipopolysaccharide, interferon-gamma, interleukin-1beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, or phorbol ester. In contrast, the phorbol ester-stimulated CNP secretion rate from THP-1 cells was suppressed with dexamethasone, which inhibits monocyte differentiation into macrophage.\nQuestion: Is c-type natriuretic peptide synthesized and secreted from leukemia cell lines , peripheral blood cells , and peritoneal macrophages?"}], "answer": "[True].

To understand the process of cell-cycle chromosome dynamics further, we have performed the first detailed characterization of a mutation affecting mitotic chromosome condensation in a metazoan. Our combined genetic and cytological approaches in Drosophila complement and extend existing work employing yeast genetics and Xenopus in vitro extract systems to characterize higher-order chromosome structure and function.\nRESULTS: Two alleles of the ORC2 gene were found to cause death late in larval development, with defects in cell-cycle progression (delays in S-phase entry and metaphase exit) and chromosome condensation in mitosis. During S-phase progression in wild-type cells, euchromatin replicates early and heterochromatin replicates late. Both alleles disrupted the normal pattern of chromosomal replication, with some euchromatic regions replicating even later than heterochromatin. Mitotic chromosomes were irregularly condensed, with the abnormally late replicating regions of euchromatin exhibiting the greatest problems in mitotic condensation.\nQuestion: Does aberrant replication timing induce defective chromosome condensation in Drosophila ORC2 mutants?"}], "answer": "[True].

For PBL, this effect did not correlate with an apoptotic phenotype. In the case of the tumor cell lines, even though the irradiation-induced inhibition of membrane transporters was accompanied by phosphatidylserine exposure, only a minority of cells had lost their mitochondrial membrane potential during the observation period.

The effect of IL-17 on osteoclastogenesis was evaluated by TRAP staining, actin ring staining, and the pit formation assay.\nRESULTS: The immunoreactivity for Th17, IL-17, IL-17R, and IL-6 was detected in PDL tissue subjected to the orthodontic force on day 7. IL-17 increased the release of IL-6 from human periodontal ligament cells in a time-dependent manner. Moreover, IL-17 stimulated osteoclastogenesis from human osteoclast precursor cells, and these effects were partially suppressed by an anti-IL-6 antibody.\nQuestion: Do t-helper 17 cells mediate the osteo/odontoclastogenesis induced by excessive orthodontic forces?"}], "answer": "[True]. These results suggest that Th17 cells may aggravate the process of orthodontically induced inflammatory root resorption."}
